OF B&mdash;&mdash; HOUSE</h2>
<br />

<p>It was in 1892 that Lord Bute first heard of the
matter. It was not, as stated by <i>The Times</i>
correspondent in that journal for June 8, 1897,
in or from London, but at Falkland, in Fifeshire,
and in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is no public chapel at Falkland, and
the private chapel in the house is attended by a
variety of priests, who usually come only from
Saturday to Monday. Lord Bute's diary for
the second week in August 1892 contains the
following entries:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Saturday, August 6th.</i>&mdash;Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, S.J.,
came.</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, August 7th.</i>&mdash;In afternoon with
Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> and John [Lord Dumfries] to
Palace, and then with him to the Gruoch's Den.
He gives us a long account of the psychical<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
disturbances at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;;</span> noises between his bed
and the ceiling, like continuous explosion of
petards, so that he could not hear himself speak,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"[Mr. Huggins afterwards recommended the
use of a phonograph for these noises, in order
to ascertain absolutely whether they are objective
or subjective, and I wrote so to <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> of
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.]</span></p>

<p>"<i>Monday, August 8th.</i>&mdash;Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> went
away.</p>

<p>"<i>Tuesday, August 9th.</i>&mdash;Mr. Huggins [now
Sir William Huggins], outgoing President of the
British Association, and Mrs. Huggins came.</p>

<p>"<i>Saturday, August 13th.</i>&mdash;Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>
came.</p>

<p>"<i>Sunday, August 14th.</i>&mdash;In afternoon with
the children, &amp;c., to the Palace, leaving Mr.
Huggins as much as possible alone with Father
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> (both being with us), in order to interrogate
him about the psychical noises he heard
recently at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> when there, to give a Retreat
to some nuns.</p>

<p>"<i>Monday, August 15th.</i>&mdash;Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> went
away after luncheon."</p>

<p><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>Lord Bute recalls that Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> told him
that he had been at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> for the purpose of
giving a Retreat [a series of sermons and meditations]
to some nuns, who were charitably
allowed by Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> to take a sort of holiday,
at a house called <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> Cottage, which had
been originally built and occupied by the late
Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> when he first took up his residence
at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> which at the time was let.</p>

<p>Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> told Lord Bute that in consequence
of the disturbance his room had been
several times changed, and he expressed surprise
that the sounds did not appear to be heard by
anybody except himself. He also said that he
had spoken of the matter to Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who
expressed an idea that the disturbances might
be caused by his uncle, the late Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
who was trying to attract attention in order
that prayers might be offered for the repose
of his soul. The sounds occurred during full
daylight, and in a clear open space between
his bed and the ceiling. He did not know
to what to compare them, but as he said
they were explosive in sound, Lord Bute suggested
that they might be compared to the<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
sounds made by petards, which are commonly
used in Italy for firing <i>feux de joie</i>. Father
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> answered, "Yes perhaps, if they were
continuous enough." He said that the sound
which alarmed him more than any other was
as of a large animal throwing itself violently
against the bottom of his door, outside. A third
noise which he had heard was of ordinary raps,
of the kind called "spirit-raps." He mentioned
a fourth sound, the nature of which Lord Bute
does not remember with the same certainty as
the others, but believes it was a shriek or
scream. Such a sound is described by other
witnesses during the subsequent occupation of
the house by the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family. The fact that
the sounds appear to have been inaudible to
every one except Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> is a strong
argument in favour of their subjective, or
hallucinatory, character. It will be found that
this was very often the case with the peculiar
sounds recorded at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and even when they
were heard by several persons at the same time,
there does not appear to be any ground for
refusing to recognise them as collective hallucinations.</p>

<p><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>Lord Bute's diary and recollections have been
here quoted, not as differing from, but only as
being antecedent to, the following account, which
has been furnished by Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">himself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I went to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> on Thursday, July 14th,
1892, and I left it on Saturday, July 23rd. So
I slept at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> for nine nights, or rather
one night, because I was disturbed by very
queer and extraordinary noises every night
except the last, which I spent in Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>
dressing-room. At first I occupied the room to
the extreme right of the landing [No. 8],<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> then
my things were removed to another room [No. 3]
(it seems to me at this distance of time that
<i>this</i> room faced the principal staircase, or was a
little to the left of it). In both these rooms I
heard the loud and inexplicable noises every
night, but on two or three nights, in addition
to these, another noise affrighted me&mdash;a sound
of somebody or something falling against the
door outside. It seemed, at the time, as if a
calf or big dog would make such a noise. Why
those particular animals came into my head I<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
cannot tell. But in attempting to describe
these indescribable phenomena, I notice now I
always do say it was like a calf or big dog
falling against the door. Why did I not hear
the noises on the ninth night? Were there
none where I was? These are questions the
answers to which are not apparent. It may be
there <i>were</i> noises, but I slept too soundly to
hear them. One of the oddest things in my
case, in connection with the house, is that it
appeared to me somehow that (1) Somebody
was relieved by my departure; (2) that nothing
could induce me to pass another night there, at
all events alone, and in other respects I do not
think I am a coward."</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who are not aware of
the fact, it may be as well to state that the class
of people known as spiritualists, hold that when
raps are heard, it is the best thing for the hearer
to say aloud, "If you are intelligent, will you
please to rap three times?" and if this is
done, to ask the intelligence to rap three
times for <i>yes</i>, once for <i>no</i>, and twice for <i>doubtful</i>.
It is obvious that considerable conversation
can be carried on by such a code, and<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
where it is inadequate, as, for instance, in
obtaining proper names, it is usual to propose
to repeat the alphabet slowly, asking the intelligence
to rap once when the proper letter
is reached. This simple method was entirely
unknown to Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;.</span> He had done nothing
but throw holy water about his rooms,
and repeat the prayer <i>Visita qu&aelig;sumus</i>, which
invokes the Divine protection of a house and
its inhabitants against all the snares of the
Enemy, and which, therefore, in no way concerned
any person or thing which is not associated
with the powers of darkness. It was
natural that no result should be produced.</p>

<p>Sir W. Huggins told Lord Bute, as the result
of his examination of Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> that he
felt absolutely certain that what the latter had
experienced was not the outcome of morbid
hallucination, but that it was possible that the
sounds themselves might be hallucinatory or
subjective. To ascertain whether this were so,
or whether they had any physical cause, he
suggested the use of a phonograph, as this
would at least show whether the sounds were
accompanied by atmospheric waves. Lord Bute<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
happened to know Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> slightly, having
met him accidentally while travelling abroad.
He accordingly wrote to him, and communicated
Sir William Huggins's suggestion. Mr.
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> after a delay of some days, refused
absolutely to allow any scientific investigation
to be made, a refusal remarkably coincident
with the recent refusal of his son, the present
proprietor, to allow any similar investigation
with seismographical instruments. It would
seem a legitimate conclusion that neither father
nor son doubted that the sounds are of a
psychical character. As regards the present
proprietor, such a conclusion renders it obvious
that we must understand in some peculiar sense
the letter published in <i>The Times</i>, dated June
10, 1897, in which he says, "As to the stories
contained in the article [<i>i.e.</i> of the anonymous
<i>Times</i> correspondent], they are without foundation."
These words must, however, be, in any
case, accepted in a special sense, considering the
part taken by members of his own family, as
well as by tenants and agents, in attesting the
stories in question.</p>

<p>Lord Bute states that Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> did not,<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
upon the occasion of his visit to Falkland, say
anything as to having seen the brown wooden
crucifix (<a href="#Page_132">see pp. 132</a>, <a href="#Page_142">142</a>, <a href="#Page_154">154</a>), but after this
apparition had been seen by two other persons
separately, Lord Bute wrote to Father
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> to inquire whether he could remember
anything of the sort. His reply was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you mention the brown wooden crucifix,
you awaken a new memory in me. I now
seem to live some of those hours over again, and
I recollect that between waking and sleeping
there appeared before my eyes&mdash;somewhere on
the wall&mdash;a crucifix, some eighteen inches, I
should say, long, and, <i>I think</i>, of <i>brown</i>
wood.</p>

<p>"My own crucifix is of black metal, and just
the length of this page (seven inches); and
though I usually have it with me in my bag,
I cannot for certain say that it was in my bag
at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;."</span></p>

<p>The following further communication from
Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> carries the record further
back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In August 1893 it was that I met, quite by<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>
accident, a person who knew something about
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House and its strange noises.</p>

<p>"Though, on my leaving his house, Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>
begged me not 'to give the house a bad name,'
I did not understand by this that, as a point of
honour, I should refrain from ever mentioning
the subject. I respected his request to the
extent of not alluding indiscriminately to the
noises that disturbed my nights there. But I
did speak to several people about them, and
they had so impatiently and incredulously heard
my statements, that I at last refused to repeat
them, even when pressingly requested to do so.
It was, therefore, quite a surprise to find myself
talking about <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House, or rather, listening
with rapt attention to another talking about
the place.</p>

<p>"Miss <span class="ws">Y&mdash;&mdash;,</span> I think her name was, kept
house for a priest <span class="ws">at&mdash;&mdash;.</span> One evening, while
on a visit there, I found her knitting as I passed
the kitchen door, and bidding her the time of
day, I discovered from a remark she made
that she had in former days filled more important
posts. She soon settled down when
she found me an attentive listener to a<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
somewhat detailed account of by no means a short
life.</p>

<p>"'Had she been in Scotland?' 'Yes, sir;
and in a very beautiful part of Scotland, in
<span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;shire.'</span> 'Indeed!' In short she told me
that she had been, twelve years ago, governess
in the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House. (I need
not say that I was now intensely interested.)
'Why did she leave?' 'Well, sir, so many
people complained of queer noises in the house,
that I got alarmed and left.' I asked her had
she seen anything? She said No, and the noises
were only heard in certain rooms, and the
servants inhabited quite a different part of the
house. When I closely questioned her she
located the queer noises precisely in the two
rooms I had successively occupied. She did
not learn from me that I had ever been there.
Pressed for a concrete case of fright and abrupt
leavetaking (I <i>think</i>), she told me two military
officers had 'left next morning.'</p>

<p>"In conclusion, as against all the above, my
own, and this good woman's account, I must set
it down that, before I left the house, two young
ladies, relatives of the family, occupied the<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
rooms in question, and certainly, to my surprise,
did not seem at breakfast as if they had spent
an unquiet night."</p>

<p>Inquiry shows that Miss <span class="ws">Y&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> residence
at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> must have been about the years
1878-80.</p>

<p>The earliest witnesses in chronological
sequence would be the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family themselves;
but though much information has been
contributed by them to various persons interested
in <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House during the tenancy
both of Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Colonel Taylor, the
present Editors are unwilling to make use of
it without permission.</p>

<p>A statement in <i>The Times</i> article, of the character
of which the reader can here judge for
himself, elicited the following letter from Mrs.
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> which is to be found in the issue of that
journal for June 18, 1897:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I ask of your courtesy to insert this
in the next issue of your paper. Seeing myself
dragged into publicity in <i>The Times</i> of June 8,
as 'having made admissions under pressure of
cross-examination,' I beg to state that I as well
as the rest of my family had not the remotest<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
idea that our home was let to other than
ordinary tenants. In my intercourse with them
I spoke as one lady to another, never imagining
that my private conversations were going to be
used for purposes carefully concealed from me&mdash;a
deceit which I deeply resent."</p>

<p>It will be observed that Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> here
leaves no doubt as to the nature of the information
with which she was so good as to
favour Miss Freer, but, notwithstanding this
fact, and the language which Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> has
considered it right to use&mdash;or, at least, to sign&mdash;with
regard to Miss Freer, Miss Freer prefers
to continue to treat Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> statements as
confidential, and blanks will accordingly be found
in the Journal under the dates on which such
conversations occurred. Miss Freer extends the
same regard for a privacy, which the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family
have themselves violated, to communications
made by other members. There have, however,
been several witnesses unconnected with them,
some of whom are referred to in the Journal.
Not only the villagers and persons in the immediate
neighbourhood, but many accidentally
met with in visits to show-places and in<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
excursions for twenty miles round <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> were ready
to pour out traditions and experiences which
are not here quoted, as, though often suggestive,
not always evidential.</p>

<p>The Rev. P. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> already referred to, quotes
a witness who testifies to processions of monks
or nuns having been seen by Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> from a
window, and of a married couple who, "relating
the events of the night, declared they could not
hear each other's voices for the noise overhead
between them and the ceiling," which was
especially interesting to him, as corroborative of
his own experience.</p>

<p>A former servant at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> has voluntarily
related, at great length, the story of the alleged
hauntings, which shows that they have occurred
at intervals during the past twenty years. He
is of opinion that as the earlier hauntings were
ascribed to the late Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> so their
revival may be referred to the late proprietor;
but his reasons, as well as his narrative, are
of a nature which might cause annoyance to
the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family, and are therefore withheld.</p>

<p>Dr. Menzies, a correspondent of <i>The Times</i>,<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
June 10th, who speaks of himself as an old friend
of Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> refers to a still earlier haunting&mdash;a
tradition current at the time of the Major's
succession in 1844.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>In August 1896, <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House, with the
shooting attached, was let by Captain <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
the present proprietor, for a year to a wealthy
family of Spanish origin. Their experience was
of such a nature that they abandoned the house
at the end of seven weeks, thus forfeiting the
greater part of their rent, which had been paid
in advance. The evidence of Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> himself,
of his butler, and of several guests, will be
found in due chronological sequence.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>When Colonel Taylor, one of the fundamental
members of the London Spiritualist
Alliance, a distinguished member of the
S.P.R., whose name is associated both in
this country and in America with the investigation
of haunted houses, offered to take a
lease of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House, after the lease had been
resigned by Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the proprietor made no
objection whatever. Indeed, the only allusion
made to the haunting was the expression of a<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
hope on the part of Captain <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> agents in
Edinburgh, that Colonel Taylor would not make
it a subject of complaint, as had been done by
Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> in reply to which they were informed
that Colonel Taylor was thoroughly well
aware of what had happened during Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>
tenancy, and would undertake to make no complaint
on the subject. Captain <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> having
thus thrown the house into the open market,
and let it to the well-known expert, with no
reference whatever to the subject of haunting,
except that it should not be made a ground
of complaint, it is obvious that he deprived
himself of any right to complain as to observations
upon the subject of local hallucination,
any more than of observation upon the habits
of squirrels or other local features. Nor had he
any more right to complain upon this ground,
as vendor of the lease, than any other vendor
of articles exposed for public sale, such as a
hatter, who after selling a hat to Lord Salisbury,
might complain that he had been induced to
provide headgear for a Conservative. At the
same time, both Colonel Taylor and his friends
were well aware, from a vexatious experience,<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
that phenomena of the kind found at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
are very often associated with private matters,
which the members of a family concerned might
object to see published, just as they might
object to the publication of the results of an
examination of some object&mdash;say, old medicine-bottles&mdash;found
in the house let by them to a
strange tenant.</p>

<p>Acting upon this knowledge, it has been the
general rule of the Society for Psychical Research
to publish the cases investigated by it under
avowedly false names, as private cases are
published in medical and other scientific journals.
Out of a courteous anxiety that nothing should
occur which could in any way annoy any
member of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family, no one was
admitted to the house for the purpose of observing
the phenomena, except on the definite
understanding that they were to regard everything
as confidential, and it was always intended
that any publication on the subject was to be
made with all names and geographical indications
avowedly fictitious.</p>

<p>As certain points of Gaelic orthography were
found to be involved, it was decided to mention<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
the house as standing in a bi-lingual district
upon the borders of Wales, and Lord Bute
arranged with Sir William Lewis to have these
linguistic points represented by Welsh instead of
Gaelic.</p>

<p>The affairs of the inquiry, and of any phenomena
which might occur, were thus protected,
it was believed, by a confidence even more
absolute than that usually observed in such
affairs of a household as to which honour dictates
that a guest should be silent.</p>

<p>The appreciation with which the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>
family responded to this courteous and careful
consideration for their possible feelings, was
made manifest to the world by the tone which
they adopted when, immediately on the appearance
of the anonymous article in <i>The Times</i>,
they rushed into the newspapers, and published
everything concerning themselves, their family
property, predecessors, and tenants, with all the
proper names at full length. After that outburst
it has, of course, been rendered impossible to
keep the identity of the place and people any
longer secret.</p>

<p>Out of deference to other members of the<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
family who did not take part in this, the matter
in the present volume remains in as private a
form as the newspaper correspondence now
leaves possible.</p>

<p>The names given in full are those mostly
very indirectly concerned; other names, including
that of the house, are given under the real
initials, with the exception of a few of the less
prominent, when the real initials would create
confusion; and in these latter cases they are
taken from letters of the alphabet not already
used, and are placed in inverted commas; <i>e.g.</i> the
real initial of a Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> is changed, in order
to avoid confusion with the name of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>
family themselves, the proprietors of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>The contents of the book are, except in one
respect, arranged upon the simple chronological
system. They commence with a short sketch
of the history of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family, based in its
earlier part upon Douglas's "Baronage of Scotland";
and all information which the writers
possess as to the phenomena which have occurred
since the death of Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> in 1876, except
that supplied by the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family, is set forth
in succession.</p>

<p><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>The family of <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> date from the earlier
part of the middle of the fifteenth century, and
were settled upon the river <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> within that
century, while they have possessed <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> at
least since the earlier half of the century
following.</p>

<p>A stone, carved with their arms, belonging to
the old mansion-house, is built into the wall, and
dated 1579. The present house is modern, and
does not even occupy the site of the older one.</p>

<p>The particular proprietor whose arms are so
represented, Patrick <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> married Elizabeth
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who survived him and married a second
time. James <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> his son, in 1586, married
Mary <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and after her death, in 1597,
Elizabeth <span class="ws">R&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>Robert <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> his son by his first marriage,
married Margaret <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;.</span> John <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> son of
Robert, was killed by the Cromwellians, leaving
no issue, and was succeeded by his brother,
Patrick <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who married Elizabeth <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>It is not obvious when they adopted the
principles of the Reformation, but it is to be
remarked that this Patrick stood high in the
favour of James II. (and VII.).</p>

<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>Charles <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> son of the foregoing, married
Anne <span class="ws">D&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and was succeeded by his third
son, another Charles, who married Grizell
<span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and died in 1764.</p>

<p>Robert <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> his son, married Isabel <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;.</span>
Charles <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> his eldest son, died unmarried
in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> second son of <span class="ws">R&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
married Louisa <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> died in 1834, and had
issue&mdash;Robert, two other sons, and six daughters.</p>

<p>Robert <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> born January 1806, in 1825
entered the military service of the East India
Company, from which he retired with the rank
of Major in 1850, <i>i.e.</i> sixteen years after succeeding
to the property. He died in April
1876. His two brothers both died unmarried,
and of his six sisters, three married, and a
fourth, Isabella, entered a nunnery. She there
professed under the name of "Frances Helen"
in 1850, the year of her brother's return from
India, and died February 23, 1880, aged
sixty-six.</p>

<p>Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> by his will dated June 8, 1853,
bequeathed <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> to the representatives of his
married sister Mary, and on his death was<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
accordingly succeeded by her second (but eldest
surviving) son, John, who on succeeding assumed
the name of <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> was a Protestant, but this John
was a Roman Catholic, like his aunt Isabella.
His eldest brother died without issue in 1867,
but he had a younger brother, married, with
issue, and two sisters, Louisa and Mary, whom
Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> by a codicil of December 14,
1868, carefully excluded from all benefit under
his will.</p>

<p>The register of the parish of L&mdash;&mdash;, in which
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House is situated, mentions under the
date July 14, 1873, the death of Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
housekeeper of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House (single), aged
twenty-seven years, daughter of John <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
farmer, and Helen <span class="ws">R&mdash;&mdash;.</span> (In Scottish legal
documents married women are described by their
maiden name.) It is said that her last illness was
very short, lasting only three days. Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>
had the great charity to attend her on her deathbed.
It is mentioned in the register, that the
official intimation of Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> death was
given, not by her parents nor by Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
but by her uncle, Neil <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> seems to have been somewhat
eccentric, and was very fond of dogs, of which
he kept a considerable number. He had very
strong views upon psychical subjects. He was
a believer in spirit-return, and many witnesses
have attested that he frequently spoke of his
own return after death. Among these psychic
beliefs were two relating to animals; and as
they are of a kind not very commonly discussed
even among spiritualists, and enter, to some
extent, into the following narrative, it is convenient
here to state them at length. It is
very commonly held that the soul or living personality
of man, which will survive the change
called by us "death," is capable of entering
living bodies and making use of their organs.
The form in which this belief is most commonly
met with, is that of the alleged inspiration of
trance mediums by the souls of the dead. Such
a case is that of Mrs. Piper, said to have been
animated by the soul of Dr. Phinuit and other
personalities now disincarnated. It has naturally
been argued that if it is possible for the
disembodied spirit to occupy and animate the
body of a human being, it would, <i>a fortiori</i>, be<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
easy for it to do the same with the body of a
beast, where the resistance of will would presumably
be less.</p>

<p>This idea, coupled with the belief that the
soul can be separated from the body during life,
so producing a kind of temporary death, while
leaving the body in such a state that it is
capable of being again inhabited and animated,
lies at the bottom of the numerous statements
as to sorcerers and sorceresses changing themselves
into hares, wolves, or cats, which are to
be found in the records of witch trials.</p>

<p>That this was possible, at least after death,
was evidently a strong belief upon the part of
Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;.</span> We are informed that he frequently
intimated his intention of entering the
body of a particular black spaniel which he possessed,
and so strong a belief was attached to
his words, that after his death all his dogs,
including the spaniel in question, were shot,
apparently in order to render impossible any
such action upon his part. The policy of the
measure adopted was short-sighted. If the
Major had thoroughly succeeded in animating
the body of the living spaniel, the physical<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
resources at his disposal would have been too
limited to have enabled him to give much
trouble. As it is, a series of witnesses attest
apparitions of this spaniel, and of at least one
other dog, which may naturally be regarded
as much more disturbing.</p>

<p>The second point is possibly the same as the
last, but it appears to be more probably based
upon the belief held by Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> in common
with a large number of those who have made a
serious study of apparitions&mdash;and certainly a
large number of the members of the S.P.R.&mdash;that
such apparitions are really hallucinations
or false impressions upon the senses, created, so
far as originated by any external cause, by
other minds either in the body or out of the
body, which are themselves invisible in the
ordinary and physical sense of the term, and
really acting through some means at present
very imperfectly known. Such an opinion of
course reserves the question of the possible
action of unseen forces upon what is commonly
called matter involved in 'spirit'-photography,
materialisation, levitation, the passage of matter
through matter, and other forms of <i>apport</i>,<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>
although such a distinction, if logically carried
out, becomes somewhat tenuous in face of the
generally accepted fact that all mental processes
are accompanied by physical processes in the
brain. In the following pages will be found
instances of the phenomenon of the apparent
removal of bed-clothing, which raise a question
as to the propriety of regarding as exhaustive
an explanation based solely upon the hypothesis
of subjective hallucination which otherwise
would appear to be generally applicable.
It would stand to reason that if such an intelligence
can produce an hallucination of the
appearance of the human figure, it would be at
least equally easy for it to produce an hallucination
of the appearance of a beast. A belief to
this effect seems to be the explanation of the
fact mentioned in a letter to <i>The Times</i> of June
10, 1897, by Dr. Menzies, who refers to Major
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> as "an old and dear friend." He writes,
"I have no doubt that he created much scandal
by saying to his gardener that he had better
take care to keep up the garden properly, for
when he was gone his soul would go into a
mole and haunt the garden and him too."</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>This theory of the possibility of producing by
mental force the hallucination audible or visual
of a beast, may also be the explanation, not only
of the apparition of the large dog which has
been seen, as well as that of a spaniel, but also
of the phenomenon, attested by several witnesses,
of their having heard the sound as of a large
dog throwing itself from the outside against
the lower part of their doors.</p>

<p>Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> died, as already stated, in 1876,
and was buried beside Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;</span> and, it is
said, an old Indian manservant. The grave is
in the middle of the parish churchyard. No
monument marks their resting-place, but a
high enclosure, which surrounds it, is a prominent
object. The whole of his dogs, fourteen
in number, including the spaniel already
mentioned, were killed after his death.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The S.P.R. some years ago published a
census of hallucinations based upon the interrogation
of seventeen thousand persons, who
were not only taken casually, but from whom
those were excluded whose replies were foreseen.
From the analysis of these statistics, it<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
appears that the great majority of these phantasms
are figures of people who were living and
continue to live, although research seems to
point to the fact that their bodies are either
always, or very often, in a state of apparent unconsciousness
at the moment of the phenomenon.
Among the minority, <i>i.e.</i> of apparitions of the
dead, the frequency seems to be in inverse proportion
to the time which has elapsed since death.
Those which appear at the moment of death
are very frequent, whereas, on the other hand,
those of persons who have been very long dead
are almost unknown; <i>e.g.</i> the apparition seen by
Lady Galway a few years ago at Rufford Abbey,
where the form represented a person who must
have been dead for about three hundred years,
belongs to a class of which examples are very few.</p>

<p>A haunted house (or any other locality) is
merely a place where experience shows that
hallucinations are more or less localised, and the
only especially interesting question about it is,
why the hallucinations should be localised at a
particular place, and what causes them there.</p>

<p>Such Phantasms of the Living have been discussed
in the monumental work of Mr. Myers<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>
and the late Mr. E. Gurney. They need be
no further remarked upon here, than to observe
that the following pages contain at least one
example, viz. that of the apparition of the Rev.
P. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;.</span> (<a href="#Page_119">See p. 119.</a>)</p>

<p>It is very difficult to judge of the forces which
may act in the conditions of what we are accustomed
to call "another world," but a plausible
explanation might be found in the Divine Word,
"Where your treasure is, there will your heart
be also." The thoughts and affections appear to
dwell for a time where they have been already
fixed during life, but changes here, including the
gradual reunion on the other side, of all those
who are loved with those who love them, the
advancing dissociation of the mind with things
here, and, no doubt, the evolution of a different
life under different conditions, seem gradually to
efface the ties of earthly memory, connecting the
feelings with particular spots on earth.</p>

<p>Such thoughts not infrequently include repentance,
a desire for the remedy of acts of injustice,
and an eagerness for the compassion and sympathetic
prayers of those whom we call the living.</p>

<p>It is natural, therefore, to suppose that<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>
haunting, such as that met with at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> would be
connected with persons who had died within
some such period as a century at the outside.
Now the number of the members of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>
family and others, whose thoughts, memories, feelings,
and affections may presumably have dwelt
largely at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and who have died within the
last hundred years, is very considerable; but&mdash;saving
the tradition referred to by Dr. Menzies
(<a href="#Page_22">see p. 22</a>), only to be dismissed&mdash;there seems
to have been no idea of the place being haunted
before the deaths of Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;</span> and of Major
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> whereas since that time the peculiar
phenomena have been constantly attested.</p>

<p>John <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> his successor, was, as stated, the
second son of Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> sister Mary, and
assumed the name of <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> upon succeeding to
the property. He was a Roman Catholic; he
was married, and had several children, of whom
the eldest son is the present proprietor. One of
the younger sons is a Jesuit, but not yet a priest.</p>

<p>In January 1895 Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> went to London
on family business, and was there killed by
being run over by a cab in the street. It was
stated on the authority of three persons, not<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>
counting members of his own family, that on
the morning on which he left <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> for the
last time, while he was talking to the agent in
his business-room, there were raps so violent
as to interfere with conversation. The earliest
written notice of this circumstance, so far as
can be discovered, is the following entry in
Lord Bute's journal for January 17, 1896:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hear that the morning the late <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> of
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> left home for the last time, spirits came
and rapped to him in his room&mdash;doubtless to
warn him&mdash;so that his death was really owing
to the cruel superstition which had prevented
him allowing them to be communicated with."</p>

<p>Lord Bute's informant appears to have been
the Rev. Sir David Hunter Blair, as the journal
mentions his arrival at Falkland on that day, and
none of the other guests in the house were people
who were likely to have heard anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> was succeeded by his eldest son,
Captain <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who showed no hesitation in
throwing the house into the public market, with
its 4400 acres of shooting. The alleged haunting
was not mentioned beforehand to the first
tenant, as it afterwards was to Colonel Taylor.</p>

<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>This tenant was Mr. J.R. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> of <span class="ws">K&mdash;&mdash;</span>
Court, <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> in <span class="ws">G&mdash;&mdash;shire,</span> and the following
is the account of experiences during his visit,
as given by his butler:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<h4>ON THE TRAIL OF A GHOST</h4>

<p class="cen"><i>To the Editor of "The Times"</i></p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your issue of the 8th, under the
above heading, 'A Correspondent' tries at
some length to describe what he calls a most
impudent imposture. I having lived at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
for three months in the autumn of last year as
butler to the house, I thought perhaps my
experience of the ghost of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> might be of
interest to many of your readers, and as the
story has now become public property, I shall
not be doing any one an injury by telling what
I know of the mystery.</p>

<p>"On July 15, 1896, I was sent by Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
with two maidservants, to take charge of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
from Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> agents. I was there three
days before the arrival of any one of the family,
and during that time I heard nothing to disturb
me in any way; but on the morning after the<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
arrival of two of the family, Master and Miss
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> they came down with long faces, giving
accounts of ghostly noises they had heard during
the night, but I tried to dissuade them from
such nonsense, as I then considered it to be;
but on the following two or three nights the
same kind of noises were heard by them, and
also by the maidservants, who slept in the
rooms above, and they all became positively
frightened. I heard nothing whatever, though
the noises, as they described them, would have
been enough to wake any one much farther
away than where I slept, for the noises they
heard were made immediately over my room.
I suggested the hot-water pipes or the twigs of
ivy knocking against the windows, but no&mdash;nothing
would persuade them but that the
house was haunted; but as the noises continued
to be heard nightly, I suggested that I should
sit up alone, and without a light, outside their
bedroom doors, where the footsteps and other
rustling noises were heard. I think one other
member of the family, or two young gentlemen,
had arrived at this time, and they had
also heard the noises. I told them of my<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
intention to sit up alone, for as one of them had
a revolver I did not want to run the risk of
being shot for a ghost. However, I took my
post on the landing at 11.30 and kept watch,
I am certain, until half-past one; then I
must have fallen asleep, for about two o'clock
Master <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> hearing the knocking as usual,
came out of his room to hear if I had
seen or heard anything, but found me fast
asleep on the floor, which gave him a greater
fright than the knocking, for he supposed for
the moment that I had been slain by the
ghost.</p>

<p>"This kind of thing went on nightly, and for
three weeks I heard nothing, although nearly
every one in the house heard these noises except
myself; but my turn had yet to come, although
I firmly held the opinion during that time
that it was the hot-water pipes, and I only
laughed at the others for their absurd nonsense,
as I then considered it to be; but my first
experience was that of being awakened three
successive nights, or rather mornings, at about
3.30. I heard nothing, but seemed to be wide
awake in an instant, as though some one had<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>
touched me. I would stay awake for some
little time and then go to sleep again; but on
the fourth night, on being awakened as before,
and lying awake for perhaps two minutes, I
heard tremendous thumping just outside my
door. I jumped out of bed quickly, and opened
my door, and called out in a loud voice, 'Who
is there?' but got no answer. I ascended the
stairs and listened for a few minutes, but heard
no further knocking. I then went back to my
room, but did not sleep again that morning.</p>

<p>"I may mention that my room was the one
described by 'A Correspondent' as the butler's
room under No. 3, the room where most noises
were heard, and the staircase was the service
one, and as there is a door at the top, if any one
had come there to make the noise I should
certainly have heard them beating a retreat.</p>

<p>"The same thing happened with variations
almost nightly for the succeeding two months
that I was there, and every visitor that came to
the house was disturbed in the same manner.
One gentleman (a colonel) told me he was
awakened on several occasions with the feeling
that some one was pulling the bedclothes off<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
him; sometimes heavy footsteps were heard, at
others like the rustling of a lady's dress; and
sometimes groans were heard, but nearly always
accompanied with heavy knocking; sometimes
the whole house would be aroused. One night
I remember five gentlemen meeting at the top
of the stairs in their night-suits, some with
sticks or pokers, one had a revolver, vowing
vengeance on the disturbers of their sleep.
During the two months after I first heard the
noises I kept watch altogether about twelve
times in various parts of the house, mostly
unknown to others (at the time), and have
heard the noises in the wing as well as other
parts.</p>

<p>"When watching I always experienced a
peculiar sensation a few minutes before hearing
any noise. I can only describe it as like
suddenly entering an ice-house, and a feeling
that some one was present and about to speak
to me. On three different nights I was
awakened by my bedclothes being pulled off
my feet. But the worst night I had at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
was one night about the second week in
September, and I shall never forget it as long<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
as I live. I had been keeping watch with two
gentlemen&mdash;one a visitor, the other one of the
house. We were sitting in room No. 2, and
heard the noises that I have described about
half-past two. Both gentlemen were very much
alarmed; but we searched everywhere, but could
not find any trace of the ghost or cause of
the noises, although they came this time from
an unoccupied room. (I may mention that
the noises were never heard in the daytime,
as stated by 'A Correspondent,' but always
between twelve, midnight, and four in the morning,
generally between two and four o'clock.)
After a thorough search the two gentlemen went
to bed sadder, but not wiser men, for we had
discovered nothing. I then went to my room,
but not to bed, for I was not satisfied, and
decided to continue the watch alone. So I
seated myself on the service stairs, close to
where the water-pipes passed up the wall, so
as to decide once and for all if the sounds came
in any way from the water-pipes.</p>

<p>"I had not long to wait (about twenty minutes)
when the knocking recommenced from the same
direction as before, but much louder than before,<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>
followed, after a very short interval, by two
distinct groans, which certainly made me feel
very uncomfortable, for it sounded like some
one being stabbed and then falling to the floor.
That was enough for me. I went and asked the
two gentlemen who had just gone to bed if they
had heard anything. One said he had heard
five knocks and two groans, the same as I had;
while the other (whose room was much nearer
to where the sounds came from) said he had
heard nothing. I then retired to my bed, but
not to sleep, for I had not been in bed three
minutes before I experienced the sensation as
before, but instead of being followed by knocking,
my bedclothes were lifted up and let fall
again&mdash;first at the foot of my bed, but gradually
coming towards my head. I held the clothes
around my neck with my hands, but they were
gently lifted in spite of my efforts to hold them.
I then reached around me with my hand, but
could feel nothing. This was immediately
followed by my being fanned as though some
bird was flying around my head, and I could
distinctly hear and feel something breathing on
me. I then tried to reach some matches that<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>
were on a chair by my bedside, but my hand
was held back as if by some invisible power.
Then the thing seemed to retire to the foot of
my bed. Then I suddenly found the foot of my
bed lifted up and carried around towards the
window for about three or four feet, then replaced
to its former position. All this did not
take, I should think, more than two or three
minutes, although at the time it seemed hours
to me. Just then the clock struck four, and,
being tired out with my long night's watching,
I fell asleep. This, Mr. Editor, is some of my
experiences while at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>"As to 'A Correspondent's' interviews with
local people:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to the old caretaker, she is an old woman,
very deaf, and she always occupied a room on
the ground floor, where, during the three months
that I was there, nothing whatever was heard,
as my two footmen slept there, and they did
not hear any noises. As to the intelligent
gardener, if it is the same one that was there
when I was there, he, surely, has not forgotten
the night he spent with me in my room; he
was nearly frightened out of his wits, and<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
declared he would not spend another night in
my room for any money&mdash;a fact that the factor
or steward and others well know.</p>

<p>"There are many other incidents in my experience
with the mystery of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> but I hope
this is sufficient for the purpose I intend it&mdash;namely,
for the truth to be known, for I have
no other motive in writing this letter; for I have
left the service of the house some months now.
But as to your correspondent's statement that
some of the house were doing it, it is simply
absurd; for in turn they were all away from
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> for a week or fortnight, and still these
noises were heard. Another thing; is it possible
for any one to keep up a joke like that for three
months? or, if any one had been doing it, I
should certainly have caught them; and I can
assure you that the house were very much
annoyed with it, not only for themselves, but for
their visitors, for I have sat up all night with
some of them, who were afraid to go to their
beds: and I think that if 'A Correspondent' had
stayed as long in <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> as I did, and had had
some of my experiences, he would have a very
different tale to tell, although up to my going<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> I would laugh at any one who told
me there were such things as ghosts; and even
now I am not quite convinced; but of one thing
I am certain&mdash;that is, that there is something
supernatural in the noises and things that I
heard and experienced at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Thanking
you, dear sir, in anticipation of your inserting
this letter, I remain your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="sc">"Harold Sanders</span>.</p>
<p class="noin">"<span class="sc">Chidcock, near Bridport, Dorset</span>."</p>
<br />

<p>The passage in <i>The Times</i> article is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An intelligent gardener whom I questioned
told me that he had kept watch in the house on
two separate occasions, abstaining from sleep
until daylight appeared at seven o'clock, but
without hearing a sound. A caretaker, who
had spent months in the house, and who had to
keep a stove alight all night, never heard a
sound, probably because there was no one to
make any."</p>

<p>The gardener's evidence on this point will be
found on p. 218.</p>

<p>Without admitting, for one moment, the<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
theory that a servant's evidence may not be of
equal value with that of the so-called educated
classes, it was thought desirable, before admitting
that of Sanders, to make some inquiries as
to his character, intelligence, and capacity for
observation. His employer spoke well of him,
and Colonel Taylor had the advantage of a
personal interview with him, which he thus
describes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>July 18th, 1897.</i>&mdash;I went to Coventry yesterday,
and saw Sanders the butler. He is a
slight, dark young man, and, as far as I could
judge, quite honest and serious over the <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> affair.
He assured me that he had written
the letter to <i>The Times</i> without any advice or
assistance, and that all he wrote was absolutely
true. I gathered from him, indirectly, that
before his <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> experience he knew nothing
of ghosts, spiritualism, or any occult matter,
and does not now. He was much astonished
when I told him that the feeling which he
describes as like walking into an ice-house
was a common one under the circumstances.
He said he omitted in his letter many small
personal matters, such as the following:&mdash;
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>During the manifestation in his room, when
his bed was shifted, and when he felt as if
some one was making 'passes' over him, and
breathing in his face, he made the sign of
the Cross, on which the 'influence' receded
from him, but approached again almost at
once. After repeating this a few times with
the same result, he crossed his arms over his
chest, and holding the bedclothes close up
to his chin, went to sleep. He was at no
time afraid. He said things were more active
during the stay of Father 'I.' than at any
other time, and that one of the young <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span>
had seen a veiled lady pass through his
room."</p>

<p>The following paragraph in the letter of <i>The
Times</i> correspondent called forth the subjoined
letter from Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> himself, the tenant of
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The only mystery in the matter seems to
be the mode in which a prosaic and ordinary
dwelling was endowed with so evil a reputation.
I was assured in London that it had
had this reputation for twenty or thirty years.
The family lawyer in <span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> asserted most<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>
positively that there had never been a whisper
of such a thing until the house was let for
last year's shooting season to a family, whom
I may call the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s.</span> I was told the same
thing in equally positive terms by the minister
of the parish, a level-headed man from
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;shire,</span> who has lived in the place for
twenty years. He told me that some of
the younger members of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family had
indulged in practical jokes, and boasted of
them. One of their pranks was to drop or
throw a weight upon the floor, and to draw
it back by means of a string. Another seems
to have been to thump on bedroom doors
with a boot-heel, the unmistakable marks of
which remain to this day, and were pointed
out to me by our hostess. If there are really
any noises not referable to ordinary domestic
causes, it is not improbable that these practical
jokers made a confidant of some one about
the estate, who amuses himself by occasionally&mdash;it
is only occasionally that the more remarkable
noises are said to be heard&mdash;repeating
their tricks. The steward or factor on the
estate concurs with the lawyer and the minister<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>
in denying that the house had any reputation
for being haunted before the advent of the
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family. Yet he is a Highlander, and
not without superstition; for he gave it as
his opinion that <i>if</i> there was anything in
these noises, they must be due to Black Art.
Asked what Black Art might be, he said
he could not tell, but he had often heard
about it, and had been told that when once
set going it would go on without the assistance
of its authors. He was quite clear, however
that if there is Black Art, it came in with
the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> rejoinder, which appeared in <i>The
Times</i>, was dated June 10th:&mdash;</p>


<h4><i>To the Editor of "The Times"</i></h4>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I must ask you to be good enough to
publish, on behalf of the tenant of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> a few
remarks on the article that appeared in your
paper of the 8th inst. with the heading 'On
the Trail of a Ghost.' The writer of that
article finds a very easy solution to the mystery
by attacking a private family who happened
to be tenants of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> for a short time, and<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
making them a 'scapegoat' for his argument.
I do not quite understand if your correspondent
pretends to assert that the place had not
the reputation of being haunted previous to my
tenancy for three months last year; probably
he does not charge me with originating such
reports, as he mentions a story of the visit of
a Catholic Archbishop to the house to exorcise
the ghost. This must have happened some
time ago, and proves that the house was then
supposed to be haunted. What your correspondent
does state as a fact is, that the younger
members of my family played practical jokes,
which have given rise to Lord Bute's investigations.
My object in writing to you is to
deny most emphatically this statement. The
principal proof that is brought forward to corroborate
this slander is, that the doors are
marked by the blows struck to produce the
noises heard. Surely no one could be frightened
after the cause and reason of the noises were
once ascertained by the boot-marks! But there
were no such marks on the doors when we left
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Some of our guests were with us until
very shortly before my family left, and can<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
testify to this, for the good reason that in the
endeavour to localise the extraordinary noises,
all doors and other parts of the house were
constantly examined up to the very last. When
I went to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> at the beginning of August,
my family had already been there a few days,
and at once they told me they had found out
the house was supposed to be haunted, and that
they had heard most unaccountable noises. I
had the greatest difficulty to persuade all my
people to stay in the place, and after all, we left
Scotland about the end of September, two
months earlier than usual. I personally did
not give any importance to the rumours that
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House is haunted, and attributed the
very remarkable noises heard to the hot-water
pipes and the peculiar way in which the house
is built. In fact, I have to confess I cannot
believe in ghosts, and, consequently, I did my
best to persuade everybody that <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was not
haunted, but I am afraid I was not always successful.
I hope you will forgive me for taking
up so much valuable space in your paper, but
I had to do so in self-defence against a false
accusation.&mdash;Yours faithfully, <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;."</span></p>

<p><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>It is believed that, in consequence of this
letter, Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> was threatened with legal
proceedings, which, however, have not yet been
initiated.</p>

<p>The following is the account given of the
same period by Miss "B.," a lady of some
position in the literary world:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... We arrived there on Wednesday the
25th August, the house being then tenanted by
Mr. J.R. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> of <span class="ws">K&mdash;&mdash;</span> Court, <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
<span class="ws">G&mdash;&mdash;shire.</span> The household consisted of Mr.
and Mrs. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> three sons, Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> my
sister and I, and two other guests, Colonel
<span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Major <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>"We had rooms in the wing on the ground
floor of the house, opening off the main hall,
divided from the rest of the house by a long
passage, and shut off by a swing-door. Our
rooms opened off each other, and the inner
room opened off a little sitting-room, which
had a door with glass panels leading into the
passage. The only other person who slept in
that wing of the house was Mr. Willie <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
whose room was exactly opposite the door of
our room.</p>

<p><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>"We heard a great deal of discussion about
the 'ghost' when we arrived, and so that night
my sister made me sleep in the inner room
with her. We heard nothing that night. The
next night I slept in the outer room, and
neither of us heard anything. The third night,
my sister being still a little nervous, I slept
in the inner room with her. The door of the
outer room was locked, the door between the
rooms was locked, and there was a wardrobe
placed against the door leading into the sitting-room.
We both, having taken these
precautions, fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>"I wakened suddenly in the middle of the
night, and noticed how quiet the house was.
Then I heard the clock strike two, and a few
minutes later there came a crashing, <i>vibrating</i>
batter against the door of the outer room. My
sister was sleeping very soundly, but she
started up in a moment at the noise, wide
awake.</p>

<p>"'Some one must have done that,' she said;
'such a noise could never have been made by
a ghost!'</p>

<p>"But neither of us had the courage to go out<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>
into the passage! The noise lasted, I should
say, for only two or three <i>seconds</i>, and ceased
as suddenly as it had begun. We lay awake
till the light came in, but the house was quite
quiet. I may mention, as against the 'supernatural'
origin of the sound, that it came
against the outer door, did not pass in to the
inner one, and avoided the glass-panelled door
of the sitting-room, which would certainly have
been shivered by the application of force sufficient
to produce such noise. Another very
curious thing was, that on the nights when it
came to our door (<i>we</i> only heard it once, but
other visitors heard it often) Willie <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>
heard nothing; whereas on the nights when
he was disturbed, we heard nothing, yet the
rooms were close together.</p>

<p>"The following night my sister and Miss
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> and two of her brothers sat up all night
in the morning-room, which opened off the main
hall. We sat with the door open and in the
dark, but neither heard or saw anything; the
house was absolutely still.</p>

<p>"The next night my sister and I stayed in
Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> room, watching with her. It<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>
was on the third storey of the house, and on
a line with the specially haunted room, then
occupied by Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Two of the men
sat up downstairs.</p>

<p>"After 2.30 Mr. Eustace <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> came and told
his sister we need not sit up later, as everything
was so quiet, and the noises seldom came after
that hour. He went to his room then, but his
door was scarcely closed when we all heard a
loud knocking at Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> door. We
ran out, without waiting a moment, into the
passage, where the lamps were still burning
brightly, but it was absolutely empty and quiet.
We heard it several times that night in distant
parts of the house, and once we heard a
scream, which seemed to come from overhead.
We stayed six days in the house after this,
but heard nothing more ourselves, though
every one else in the house was disturbed
nightly."</p>

<p>The Major <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> mentioned in the above
statement has been good enough to furnish
the following note as to his personal impressions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On 22nd August 1896 I arrived at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
and remained there until the 2nd September.
During this period I slept in the room on the
first floor, which is at the end of a short corridor
running from the top of the back stairs to my
room [No. 1].</p>

<p>"Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> occupied the room next to
me [No. 3]. It was a double room, connected
by a door, and was situated just at the top
of the back stair.</p>

<p>"August 24th, about 3.30 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, I heard very
loud knocking, apparently on Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>
door, about nine raps in all&mdash;three raps
quickly, one after the other, then three more
the same, and three more the same. It was
as if some one was hitting the door with his
fist as hard as he could hit. I left my room
at once, but could find nothing to account for
the noise. It was broad daylight at the time.
I heard the same noises on the 28th and 30th
August at about the same hour, viz. between
3 and 4 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>"</p>

<p>The following, which adds somewhat to the
above, was contained in a private letter written
in January 1897 from Major <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> to the Hon.
<span class="ws">E&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>"Between two and four in the morning there
used to be noises on the door (of Colonel
<span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> room), as if a very strong man were
hitting the panels as hard as ever he could
hit, three times in quick succession&mdash;a pause,
and then three times again in quick succession,
and perhaps another go. It was so
loud that I thought it was on the door of his
dressing-room, but he said he thought it was
on his bedroom door. One theory is, that it
was the hot water in the pipes getting cold,
which, I am told, would make a loud throbbing
noise. I tripped out pretty quick the
first time I heard it, but could see nothing.
Of course it is broad daylight in Scotland
then.</p>

<p>"The same banging was, I believe, heard on
one of the bedroom doors down the passage,
in the wing on the ground floor, and on investigation
I found there were hot-water pipes
just outside that door as well. There were
yarns innumerable while I was there about
shrieks and footsteps heard, and bedclothes
torn off. But I did not experience these....
I don't think the noises were done by a<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>
practical joker, as there were too many people
on the alert...."</p>

<p>The Hon. <span class="ws">E&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> wrote to Miss Freer
on March 4th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... [Major] <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> is now in London, and
I have seen him twice. He says (1) the hot-water
pipe theory is not his own, but was
suggested by an engineer friend. He should
not himself have thought that hot-water pipes
could make so big a noise. Besides, Colonel
<span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> described the noise as a banging either
against the door itself, or against the door of
the wardrobe inside the room.... (2) He,
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> heard the noise himself several times
and bolted out into the passage at once, but
saw nothing. The noise sounded like a very
loud banging at <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> door.... (3) He
confirms the story about <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> being unable
to sleep, and says he used to go to sleep on the
moor in consequence."</p>

<p>During Colonel Taylor's tenancy similar
noises were heard, both when the water was
totally cut off and when, from some defect
in the apparatus, it never reached a high
temperature.</p>

<p><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>The Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> referred to, corroborates
this account, as follows, in a letter to Major
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;:</span></p>

<p>"<span class="sc">My dear</span> <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, You write asking me about
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House and its spook. Well, I never
<i>saw</i> anything, and what I heard was what
you heard, a terrific banging at one's bedroom
door, generally about from 2 to 3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, about
two nights out of three. Of course there were
other yarns of things heard, &amp;c., but I personally
never heard or experienced anything else than
this banging at the door, which I never could
account for...."</p>

<p>Before passing from the subject of Colonel
<span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;,</span> it is as well to mention that after leaving
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> he went to stay at another country house,
and the butler there spoke to him of the haunting
of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> where he himself was a servant
some years before. This butler was asked for
further information, but sent only the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your note to hand regarding <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> I am
afraid what I saw or heard would be of little
value to your book, therefore I would rather say
nothing."</p>

<p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>It will be observed that, so far from denying
the facts, he admits that he saw and heard
certain things, which he refuses to describe; but
as this evidence is circumstantial rather than
direct, it is inserted here rather than in the
place to which, chronologically, it would, if
fuller, properly have belonged.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. "G." were also guests at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> during
the occupation of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s.</span> Mrs.
"G." published an account of her experiences
in a magazine article, of course with fictitious
names; but she affirms that she has in no
sense "written up" the story, which, indeed, is
entirely corroborated by other evidence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>October 9th, 1896.</i>&mdash;Some friends of mine
took the place this year for the shooting, and,
relying on the glowing description they had
received, took it on trust, and in July last took
possession of it without having previously seen
it. For a few days all went well; the family
established themselves in the old part of the
house, leaving a new wing for their guests. The
haunted room (for so I may justly call it) was
inhabited by two or three persons in succession,
who were so alarmed and disturbed by the<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>
violent knockings, shrieks, and groans which
they heard every night, and which were also
heard by many others along the same corridor,
that they refused to sleep there after the first
few nights. Those who serve under her
Majesty's colours are proverbially brave; they
will gladly die for their country, with sword
in hand and face to the foe. For this reason
a distinguished officer [Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;,</span> above
quoted] was the next occupant of the haunted
chamber, and was told nothing of its antecedents.
The morning after his arrival he came
down refreshed, and keen for the day's sport.
I may here mention, no one is ever disturbed
the first night of their stay. During the succeeding
nights, however, he was continually
roused from his slumbers by the most terrific
noises, and want of sleep would cause him to
become drowsy when out shooting on the moor,
and would tempt him to make a bed of the
purple heather and fragrant myrtle.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine, a man of great nerve and
courage, next inhabited the room, and went
through the same experiences. He took every
possible means to discover the cause of the<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>
sounds, and failed in accounting for them in
any way. He said the blows on the door were
so violent he often looked, expecting to see it
shattered to atoms. Since he left no one has
been put into this room, but the noises continue,
and are heard throughout the house. Even the
dogs cannot be coaxed into this room, and if
forced into it, they crouch with marked signs
of fear.</p>

<p>"The disturbances take place between 12 and
4.30, and never at any other time. A young
lady, of by no means timid disposition, and
possessed of great presence of mind, has often
heard the swing-door pushed open and footsteps
coming along the corridor, pausing at the door.
She has frequently looked out and seen nothing.
The footsteps she has also heard in her room,
and going round her bed. Many persons have
had the same experiences, and many have
heard the wild unearthly shriek which has rung
through the house in the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"I will now give my own experience. I arrived
with my husband and daughter on September 17,
having been duly warned by my friends of the
nocturnal disturbances. We were put in rooms<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>
adjoining, at the end of the new wing. I kept
a light in my room, but the first night all was
still. Next night, about 2 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, a succession
of thundering knocks came from the end of our
passage, re-echoing through the house, where it
was heard by many others. About half-an-hour
afterwards my husband heard a piercing shriek;
then all was still, save for the hooting of the
owls in the neighbouring trees. When the grey
dawn stole in it was welcome; so was the
cheery sound of the bagpipes, as the kilted
piper took his daily round in the early morning.
The next night and succeeding ones we heard
loud single knocks at different doors along our
passage. The last night but one before we left
I was roused from sleep by hearing the clock
strike one, and immediately it had ceased six
violent blows shook our own door on its hinges,
and came with frightful rapidity, followed by
deep groans. After this sleep was impossible.
The next night, our last in Scotland, my husband
and others watched in our passage all night,
and though the sounds were again heard in
different directions, nothing was to be seen.
As I write, at the commencement of October,<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>
the house on the lonely hillside is deserted;
the tenants have gone southwards; an old caretaker
(too deaf to hear the weird sounds which
nightly awaken the echoes) is the sole occupant.
Even she closes up all before dusk, and retires
into her quarters below; though she hears not,
her sight is unimpaired, and she perhaps dreads
to meet the hunchback figure which is said to
glide up the stairs, or the shadowy form of a
grey lady who paces with noiseless footfall the
lonely corridor, and has been seen to pass
through the door of one of the rooms. Within
the last two months a man with bronzed complexion
and bent figure has been seen by two
gentlemen, friends of mine. They both describe
him as having come through the door and
passed through the room in which they were
about three in the morning. I have tried to
give a faithful and accurate account of these
strange events. I leave it to each and all to
form their own opinion on the matter."</p>

<p>Some passages in private letters to Miss Freer
and Lord Bute written by Mrs. "G.," should
be quoted as bearing upon some points in the
above:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>"<i>February 9th.</i>&mdash;I am going to ask you if
you do go there [<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House] if you would let
me know if you see or hear anything. I
am immensely interested in it, as we stayed
there in the autumn with some friends who
took it, and anything more horribly haunted
could not be. I never should have believed
it if I had not been there."</p>

<p>After the appearance of <i>The Times</i> correspondent's
accusation against the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family,
Mrs. "G." wrote as follows to Lord
Bute:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;If the noises complained of
by nearly all who have stayed at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> were
the result of practical jokes perpetrated by
the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s,</span> how is it that not only were
they heard by guests who stayed there years
ago, but are admitted by members of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>
family to have been heard by themselves?
Miss Freer also has told me, that the same
noises were heard at all hours day and night
by herself and her guests for months after the
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family and their servants had left
Scotland. This so completely exonerates them
from the absurd charge, that I should hardly<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>
have mentioned it, had not Miss Freer seemed
quite under the impression that practical jokes
had been played during the tenancy of the
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s;</span> and as a proof of this, she told me
that the doors, especially of two of the rooms,
were marked with nailed boots, and the panels
even split through, and this damage was
attributed by her to the younger members
of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family. I am happy to say
I was able to disabuse her mind of this
idea, as we were staying at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> within a
few days of their leaving Scotland, and I
had most carefully examined the doors especially
of the two rooms specified, one of
which was our own room. There was not a
scratch, nor the smallest mark or indentation;
others can also vouch for this fact. The
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> had all left <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> for good at that
time, except the eldest son, and Miss Freer
agreed with me that whatever damage was
done to the doors, must therefore have been
done after the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> left, and before her
party came in.... The hot-water pipe
theory revived by the writer of the article
in <i>The Times</i> is disproved by Miss Freer,<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
who told me that the hot-water apparatus
was not used for some time, and that the disturbances
continued just the same.... The
stories told in connection with <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> were
not circulated or started by the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family.
They were told <i>to</i> them by persons living
around <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;."</span></p>

<p>In a letter to Miss Freer, dated June 12th,
Mrs. "G." writes, in reference to the charge of
practical joking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are the most unlikely family to do
such a thing; and besides, if further proof were
wanted, the young men of the family were away
from <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> when we stayed there ten days,
and there was only one night when we did not
hear the noises."</p>

<p>Miss Freer of course entirely accepts Mrs.
"G.'s" statement, and that of Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> as
published in <i>The Times</i>. She had been led to
her earlier conclusions as to the marks of a
boot-heel on the upper panels of the doors
by the statements of interested persons.</p>

<p>A suggestive point in this connection is the
fact, to which Miss "G." has herself testified,
that while Mr. and Mrs. "G." were disturbed<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>
to the utmost degree, their daughter, who slept
in a room communicating with that of her
mother, heard nothing whatever; from which
it would appear that the noises heard by them
were subjective, and that the alleged evidence
of the boot-heel, even were it credible, would
be, in fact, irrelevant.</p>

<p>The mention of the hallucinatory nature of
such phenomena suggests attention to the intellectual
acumen displayed by <i>The Times</i> correspondent
in saying that "Lord Bute ought to
have employed a couple of intelligent detectives"
for the purpose of catching subjective
hallucinations. On the same principle, he ought
to offer to his learned friend, Sir James Crichton-Browne,
well known as an alienist, some advice
as to the best mode of securing morbid hallucinations
in strait-waistcoats. Is he prepared
to propose to take photographs of a dream, to
put thoughts under lock and key, or to advocate
the supply of hot and cold water on every floor
of a castle in the air?</p>

<p>One of the guests at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> during Colonel
Taylor's tenancy wrote after his return to
London to Miss Freer as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>"<i>March 24th.</i>&mdash;I went to call the other
day on the 'G.'s' who chanced to be still in
town.... I begin chronologically, and give
you what I was told in all seriousness.... The
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> knew nothing about any stories of
haunting when they took the place, and Miss
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> and one of the sons went up, most
innocently, to prepare for the arrival of the
others. As soon as they entered it the son
said to his sister that he couldn't explain why,
but he had a conviction that the house was
haunted. That night, however, nothing happened.
But the second night the bangings
began. An old Spanish nurse was in the
haunted room, and was greatly disturbed by
the noise upon her door, which seemed as if it
were going to be burst open. She didn't seem
to be alarmed in the least however, and later
took steps to secure its remaining shut by stuffing
a towel under the chink (why this should
secure it I rather fail to see, still that was her
view). Apparently the ghost resented this, and
one night did actually burst the door open, with
such violence that the towel was precipitated
into the middle of the room. The longer they<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>
stayed in the house, the worse things got. The
noises were all over the house more or less,
and were by no means confined to bangings.
Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> slept in room No. 8, where the
ghost limped round her bed. She was so
alarmed that she fetched her brother in, and
he slept on the sofa. The limping began again,
and she asked him if he heard anything, and
he at once agreed that somebody was walking
round the bed. In his own room&mdash;I forget
which&mdash;he twice <i>saw</i> the ghost, once in the
shape of an indeterminate mist, once in the
shape of a man, who came in by the door
and vanished in the wall. Mrs. 'G.'<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> now
appears on the scene, and slept in No. 1 (I
<i>think</i>). She heard only the bangings, which
she declares were indescribably loud. They
were mostly at the door of the haunted room.
Traps were laid to catch unwary jesters; the
door, or the surrounding floor, I forget which,
was covered with flour, and wires were stretched
across the door; and if I had the proper mind<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>
of a ghost-story narrator, I should say that the
bangings were as bad as ever, and the flour and
the wires were found undisturbed.</p>

<p>"But as a matter of fact she didn't say that,
though doubtless she intended to, but jumped
on to something else. Mr. "G.," who was
there some weeks after his wife, was put down
in the wing&mdash;I don't know which room&mdash;and
had visitations. He heard steps approach down
the passage, followed by a heavy body flinging
itself against his door. He also heard screams,
which seemed to him to recede as though the
screamer was passing through the walls. (I
couldn't quite understand this effect, but that
was how he described it.) Their chaplain, who
was put into the haunted room, was also greatly
worried, and both he and the Spanish nurse
and Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> all had the sensation that
their bedclothes were being pulled off, and they
had to hold on to them to prevent their departure.
The most interesting part of the story
is that Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> later admitted to Mrs. "G."
that it was quite true the house was supposed
to be haunted, that she had lived there for
twenty years, and at various times there had<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>
been outbreaks of this kind of thing of greater
or less duration, but that the outbreaks had
not been often enough for them to think it
worth while mentioning the fact to incoming
tenants. It appears also that the story of the
bangings on the table in the daylight on the
occasion of the last interview between the late
Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> and the land-steward, came from one
of the young <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;s.</span> It was also said that one
of the young <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;s</span> used to sleep in the dressing-room
between No. 1 and the haunted room,
and used to complain that somebody kept pulling
his bedclothes off.</p>

<p>"I may add that it is quite clear that the
people about the place&mdash;some of whom, on my
leaving, I vainly tried to draw&mdash;have been
threatened not to talk about the ghost. There
was no mystery about it whatever last year,
the station officials being exceedingly loquacious
and full of information...."</p>

<p>The above are the circumstances which <i>The
Times</i> correspondent thus describes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord Bute's confidence has been grossly
abused by some one. It was represented to him
by some one that he was taking the 'most<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
haunted house in Scotland,' a house with an
old and established reputation for mysterious
if not supernatural disturbances. What he
has got is a house with no reputation whatever
of that kind, with no history, with nothing
germane to his purpose beyond a cloud of baseless
rumours produced during the last twelve-month.
Who is responsible for the imposture
it is not my business to know or to inquire, but
that it is an imposture of the most shallow and
impudent kind there can be no manner of doubt.
I interviewed in <span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> a man who has the
district at his finger-tips, and was ready to
enumerate in order all the shooting properties
in the valley. He had never heard until the
moment I spoke to him of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> possessing any
reputation, ancient or modern, for being haunted,
although he is familiar with the estate, and has
slept in the house. It has no local reputation
of the kind even now beyond the parish it
stands in. The whole thing has been fudged
up in London upon the basis of some distorted
account of the practical jokes of the
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s."</span></p>

<p>As the writer in question obtained his<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
admission to the house as a guest by Sir
James Crichton-Browne's solicitation through
Sir William Huggins and Lord Bute, it might
naturally have been supposed that the real
facts were known to him, at least so far as
they were concerned. It appears, however,
that he cherished a voluntary ignorance upon
the subject, to judge from the phrase, "it is
not my business to know or to inquire." Of
such a writer, and of such statements, the
reader will now form his own opinion; but
that the correspondent in question should continue
to cling to his journalistic anonymity,
is little to be wondered at.</p>

<p>Colonel Taylor served in the Bedfordshire
Regiment. He was afterwards Professor of
Tactics at Sandhurst, and retired in 1894.
Possessed of means, leisure, and intelligence,
he chose to make the study of psychic subjects
his particular occupation. He is one of
the seven fundamental members who, in 1895,
signed the Articles of Association of the London
Spiritualist Alliance, holds office in the Society
for Psychical Research, and has rendered very
valuable services in investigation of various<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
kinds. Having made the investigation of
houses alleged to be haunted his special
province, he may be fairly considered to be
somewhat of an expert in this matter. It may,
or may not, be regarded as a drawback to his
usefulness in this direction, that he is so
peculiarly insensitive to subjective impressions,
that a man who is colour-blind would be
almost as useful a witness as to shades of
colour as Colonel Taylor upon hallucinations,
local or otherwise; but, as will be seen, he is
fertile in expedients, experienced in research,
and careful and observant of the phenomena
experienced by others.</p>

<p>Lord Bute, who takes some interest in scientific
matters, has been accustomed not infrequently
to defray the cost of scientific work
which he is unable to undertake himself, and
he offered to meet the expense of the lease of
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> if Colonel Taylor would take the house,
a proposal which he accepted.</p>

<p>This is what <i>The Times</i> correspondent of
June 8, 1897, thought proper to describe in
the words, "for reasons which are differently
stated in London and in Perth, where the agent<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>
for the proprietor is to be found, Lord Bute
did not take the house in his own name, but in
that of Colonel Taylor."</p>

<p>It would have been equally true to say of
the Coptic texts, published at Lord Bute's
expense by Mr. Budge of the British Museum,
that Lord Bute wrote and published these
books under the name of Budge.</p>

<p>Had Colonel Taylor been prevented by circumstances
from becoming tenant of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
House, Sir William Crookes, the present President
of the British Association and of the
Society for Psychical Research, or Mr. Arthur
Smith, Treasurer of the S.P.R., was willing
to take the lease.</p>

<p>Having thus agreed to Lord Bute's proposal,
Colonel Taylor at once proceeded to make himself
acquainted with the history of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House.
He naturally placed himself in communication
with the late tenant, assuming that that gentleman
would be willing to assist in investigating
the phenomena by which his family and guests
had been annoyed. But the only information
which Mr. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> seemed disposed to give was
an admission that some members of his family<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>
had heard noises, and that the house was locally
reported to be haunted.</p>

<p>However, other sources of information as to
the experiences of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> establishment were
fortunately available.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> agents made no scruple
about letting the house to the well-known
expert. The Edinburgh agents, Messrs. Speedy,
indeed mentioned the haunting, and expressed
the hope that Colonel Taylor would not make
it the subject of complaint, as had been done
by the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family, and they received the
assurance that this was not a score upon which
he would give trouble. In regard to the letters
of Messrs. R.H. Moncrieff &amp; Co., dated June
12, 1897, which appeared in <i>The Times</i>, it
can only be said that the impression which
they were likely to convey was, that Colonel
Taylor was an imaginary being like John
Doe or Richard Roe. Their scepticism must
have been of recent origin, since none was
manifested on receiving his rent. Their position
is in any case unfortunate, since, even
if unclouded by doubt as to the Colonel's
personality, they appear to wish the public to<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
believe that they seriously thought that one
well known as a Spiritualist in England and
America, a retired Professor of Military Tactics,
with a comfortable house at Cheltenham, a
member of the Junior United Service Club in
London, a man who neither shoots nor fishes,
had been suddenly seized in his mature years
with a desire to hire an isolated country house
in Perthshire, in the depths of winter, for the
purpose of trying his 'prentice hand upon rabbit-shooting
on a small scale.</p>

<p>Colonel Taylor, who is a widower without a
daughter, was at this time much occupied by
the illness and death of a near relative, and
was unable for the moment to take up residence
at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House. Lord Bute accordingly expressed
a hope that Miss Freer would undertake
to conduct the investigation. Mr. Myers also
wrote urgently to her, saying, "If you don't
get phenomena, probably no one will." She
was abroad at the time, but at considerable personal
inconvenience consented to return, and
on December 26th she wrote to Lord Bute,
stating that she could reach Ballechin on
February 2nd, and adding&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>"I have been reflecting further on the
question of the personality of investigators.
I think the names you suggest, and some
others which occur to me, divide naturally into
three classes (assuming, and I think you agree
with me, that it does not follow that every
one can discover a ghost because it is there,
nor that their failure to discover it is any
proof that it is not there). (1) Those who have
personal experience of phenomena, and may be
expected to be susceptible to psychic influences;
(2) those who have no personal powers in that
line, but are open-minded and sympathetic; and
(3) those who are passively open to conviction.
A fourth class, those who come to look for evidence
against the phenomena, but will accept
none for it, should, I think, be left until we
have some demonstrable evidence to show....
Mr. Myers proposes himself for April 14-21....
I should suggest the keeping of a diary, in which
every one willing to do so should make entries,
negative or affirmative."</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> Correspondent further criticised
the method of inquiry employed at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>"Lord Bute's original idea was a good one, but<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>
it was never properly carried out. Observing
that the S.P.R. had made many investigations
in a perfunctory and absurd manner by sending
somebody to a haunted house for a couple of
nights and then writing an utterly worthless
report, he desired in this case a continuous
investigation extending over a considerable
period. He ought, therefore, to have employed
a couple of intelligent detectives for the whole
term, and thus secured real continuity. As
things are, the only continuity is to be found in
the presence&mdash;itself not entirely continuous&mdash;of
the lady just mentioned. But simply because
she is a lady, and because she had her duties as
hostess to attend to, she is unfit to carry out
the actual work of investigating the phenomena
in question. Some of her assistants sat up all
night, with loaded guns, in a condition of abject
fright; others, there is reason to suspect, manufactured
phenomena for themselves; and nearly
all seem to have begun by assuming supernatural
interference, instead of leaving it for the final
explanation of whatever might be clearly proved
to be otherwise inexplicable."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to repudiate such a<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
condition of mind on the part of the guests at
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> but it may be well to remark that the
writer of this sapient paragraph seems to be
under the impression that every result of certain
forces at present imperfectly understood is
supernatural. The assertion that any one who
was in the house during Colonel Taylor's
tenancy believed in the possibility of the existence
of anything supernatural is, so far as the
present editors are aware, a pure fabrication,
having no foundation whatever. In their own
belief all things which exist, or can exist, are,
<i>ipso facto</i>, natural, although their nature may
not belong to the plane of being in which we
are normally accustomed to move.</p>

<p>In this connection may be usefully quoted the
following passages from Miss Freer's article in
<i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, August 1897:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some of my friends asked me how I proposed
to organise a haunted house research, to
which I could only reply that I didn't propose
to do anything of the sort. It seemed to me
that among several things to be avoided was
self-consciousness of any kind, that the natural
thing to do was to settle down to a<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>
country-house life, make it as pleasant as possible, and
await events.... The subject of the 'haunting'
was never accentuated, and we always tried to
prevent talking it over with new-comers....
As to the guests, for the most part they came
on no special principle of selection.... Several
of our visitors had more or less special interest
in the inquiry, but others merely came for a
country-house visit or for sport, and some knew
nothing whatever till after their arrival of any
special interest alleged to attach to the house....
Analysing our list of guests, I find that there
were eleven ladies, twenty-one gentlemen, and
<i>The Times</i> Correspondent. Of the gentlemen,
three were soldiers, three lawyers, two were men
of letters, one an artist, two were in business,
four were clergy, one a physician, ... and five,
men of leisure."</p>

<p>It would be unnecessary to quote all the
preliminary correspondence; but the following
passages from Lord Bute's letters to Miss Freer
help to explain the situation, and the relation
of those concerned:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>December 20th.&mdash;</i> ... I am afraid I shall
encroach even further upon your kindness.<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>
Myers has all the papers, but I fancy you
would rather know as little as possible, so
as not to be influenced by expectation. It is
no case of roughing it. <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House is, I
believe, a luxurious country house, ample,
though not too large, in a beautiful neighbourhood...."</p>

<p>A letter of December 22nd refers to a suggestion
that the phenomena were produced by
trickery, a fact which is mentioned to show
that the possibility was kept in view from the
first.</p>

<p>On January 23rd, "Not a day should be

<h2>JOURNAL KEPT DURING A<br />
VISIT TO B&mdash;&mdash; HOUSE</h2>
<br />

<div class="block"><p><i>February 3rd, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Constance Moore and I
arrived from Edinburgh, with Mac., the maid, a little
after 10 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, having sent on beforehand the following
servants:&mdash;Robinson and Mrs. Robinson, butler and cook;
Carter and Hannah, two housemaids.</p>

<p>I had engaged them on behalf of Colonel Taylor in
Edinburgh last evening. They had all good characters,
and were well recommended. We told them nothing, of
course, of the reputation of the house, and were careful to
choose persons of mature age, and not excitable girls.</p>

<p>I had seen no plans nor photographs of the house, and
merely desired that any rooms should be prepared for us
that were near together&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> bedroom, dressing-room, and
maid's room. Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> [who met us in Edinburgh, and
is a lawyer, mentioned hereafter], who had seen plans,
asked what orders we had given, and remarked that,
as far as he knew, we should secure one quiet night,
as the "haunted" part contained, apparently, no dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>The house looked very gloomy. It was not cold out of
doors, though thick snow lay on the ground. Inside it
felt like a vault, having been empty for months. None of<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>
the stores ordered had arrived. We had no linen, knives,
plate, wine, food, and very little fuel or oil. Candles and
bread and milk and a tin of meat had been got for us in
the village. We ate and went to bed. The room was
so cold that we had to cover our faces, and we had no
bed-linen. We had been very busy all day in Edinburgh,
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p><i>February 4th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;I awoke suddenly, just before
3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> Miss Moore, who had been lying awake over two
hours, said, "I want you to stay awake and listen."
Almost immediately I was startled by a loud clanging
sound, which seemed to resound through the house. The
mental image it brought to my mind was as of a long
metal bar, such as I have seen near iron-foundries, being
struck at intervals with a wooden mallet. The noise was
distinctly as of metal struck with wood; it seemed to
come diagonally across the house. It sounded so loud,
though distant, that the idea that any inmate of the
house should not hear it seems ludicrous. It was repeated
with varying degrees of intensity at frequent
intervals during the next two hours, sometimes in single
blows, sometimes double, sometimes treble, latterly continuous.
We did not get up, though not alarmed. We
had been very seriously cautioned as to the possibilities
of practical joking; and as we were alone on that floor
in a large house, of which we did not even know the
geography, we thought it wiser to await developments.
We knew the servants' staircase was distant, though not
exactly where.</p>

<p>About 4.30 we heard voices, apparently in the maid's
room, undoubtedly on the same floor. We had for some
time heard the housemaids overhead coughing,<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
occasionally speaking, and we thought they had got up and
had come down to her room.</p>

<p>After five o'clock the noises seemed to have ceased,
and Miss Moore fell asleep. About 5.30 I heard them
again, apparently more distant. I continued awake, but
heard no more.</p>

<p>About 8 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> the maid brought us some tea. She said
she had slept very badly, had worried over our apparent
restlessness, as she had heard voices and footsteps and
the sound of things dragged about, but that the maids
had not been downstairs. We had never risen, and had
spoken seldom, and in low tones, and an empty room (the
dressing-room) intervened between Mac.'s room and ours.</p>

<p>In order, as we supposed, to follow up the noises we, later,
in the day moved our rooms to the other side of the
house, especially choosing those from which the sounds
seemed to proceed&mdash;Nos. 6 and 7&mdash;leaving Mac., the maid,
in No. 3.</p>

<p>The whole day has been occupied with exploring the
house, sending for food and supplies, trying to thaw the
rooms, moving furniture to make things homelike, and
trying to arrive at a little comfort.</p>

<p>The house will soon be very pleasant, and only needs
living in, but it feels like a vault. It is very roomy and
very light. Nothing less like the conventional "haunted"
house could be conceived. The main body of the house
was built in 1806, the wing about 1883, with the apparent
object of providing the children of the family with rooms
outside the "haunted" area. It is cheerful, sunny, convenient,
healthy, and built on a very simple plan, which
admits of no dark corners or mysteries of any kind. A
pleasanter house to live in I would not desire, but it is<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>
constructed for summer rather than for winter use. It
has been added to at least twice, and there is much waste
space. The original mansion, which was, I understand,
upon a different site, was dated 1579; the new wing was
built about fourteen years ago, and consists of four rooms
and offices, adapted for schoolroom or nursery use. But
the older walls are of great thickness.</p>

<p>After dusk we sat down to rest, and for the first time
read the papers relating to the house,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> breaking open
the envelope in which Mr. Myers had given them to me.
I had done this for my own satisfaction, as I wanted, if
only for a few hours, to have as unprejudiced a presentation
of the place as was possible under the circumstances.
Miss Moore had heard some of the rumours about the
house in Edinburgh from Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
but I had avoided all information as far as I could.</p>

<p>We now learnt, to our chagrin, that we had done the
wrong thing, and had left rooms alleged to be haunted,
and taken two apparently innocent. We, however, consoled
ourselves by the reflection that we can offer the
others to our guests, and that we are at all events <i>next</i>
to No. 8, which has an evil reputation.</p></div>

<br />

<p>It is the room in which Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;</span> died,
and in which Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> heard the limping
footsteps walking round her bed.</p>

<div class="block"><p>As we had been told that the avenue is shunned by
the whole neighbourhood after dark, we went out for a
stroll up and down about six o'clock. We saw nothing,<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>
but our dog Scamp growled at the fir plantation beside
the road.</p>

<p>Mr. L. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> [eminent as an electrical engineer],
arrived about 10 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> We thought it polite to give him
a quiet night after so long a journey, and he is sleeping
in No. 5.</p>

<p><i>February 5th, Friday.</i>&mdash;Miss Moore and I slept well.
We were both desperately tired.</p>

<p>Mr. L. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> awoke suddenly at 2.30. No phenomena.
He has an excellent little apparatus, an electric flashlight,
which he is able to keep under his pillow and
turn on at a second's notice, very convenient for
"ghost" hunting&mdash;no delay, and no possibility of blowing
it out.</p>

<p>The maids tell mine that they heard the sounds below
them of continuous speaking or reading, and "supposed
the young ladies were reading to one another."</p></div>

<br />

<p>This is the first occasion on which there has
been mention of the sound of continuous reading
aloud, which afterwards became extremely familiar.
The sound was always that well known to
Roman Catholics as that of a priest "saying his
office." It may be as well to remind the reader
that Clerks in Holy Orders of that Church are,
like those of the Anglican, strictly bound to read
through the whole of the Daily Service every
day, and it is not permitted to do this merely
by the eye, the lips must utter the words. In<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>
practice some are accustomed to move the lips
with hardly any sound, and such, we have
ascertained, is the custom of the Rev. <span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;;</span> others read it absolutely aloud, and
will retire to their own rooms or other places,
where they may be alone for the purpose.
This, we heard, was the invariable practice of
the Rev. Mr. "I.," the chaplain of Mr. and
Mrs. "G."</p>

<div class="block"><p>As a matter of fact, we were sleeping on the other
side of the house, and the rooms under the maids' rooms
were empty.... In the evening, about six o'clock, we
strolled down the avenue again, and Scamp, who never
does bark except under strong excitement, again barked
and growled at the copse.</p>

<p>The Hon. E. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> a fellow-member of an S.P.R.
committee, arrives to-night. Hospitality constrains us to
put him in No. 4, which is "not haunted."</p>

<p>I asked after the success of the new kitchenmaid, a
local importation, who arrived yesterday. I was told she
had already gone. The cook told me "she talked all sorts
of nonsense about the house, and the things that had
happened in it, and had been seen in it, all day; and then
at night refused to sleep here, and the butler had to walk
home with her at eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>The Factor [<i>anglic&eacute;</i>: bailiff] came this morning, and I
fancied a special intention in his manner. He was much
annoyed about the kitchenmaid, said such talk was "all
havers" [<i>anglic&eacute;</i>: "drivel"], begged me not to employ her<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>
again, and undertook to get another, lending me a girl in
his own service meanwhile.</p>

<p>I went with him into the wing to get him to see to
things there. We have been too busy in getting the rest
of the house into order to look after it yet; but I find the
pipes are out of order, the cisterns frozen, and the "set-basins"
in the three bedrooms and bath-room out of working
order. He promised attention, but discouraged the
use of the wing. "Had we not room enough without?"
and so on. I suggested that, any way, for the sake of the
rest of the house it must be aired and thawed, and he
insisted that the kitchen fire below did that sufficiently.</p>

<p>I cannot help remembering that this is the scene of the
phenomena recorded by Miss <span class="ws">"B&mdash;&mdash;,"</span> as Duncan <span class="ws">R&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
the factor, is well aware. Also, he was persistent about
"keeping out the natives," and their chatter, if I wanted
to keep the servants, but did not specify the nature of the
chatter, and I asked no questions.</p>

<p><i>February 6th, Saturday.</i>&mdash;No phenomena last night. The
house perfectly still.</p></div>

<br />

<p>During Colonel Taylor's tenancy a good many
experiments of different kinds were made in
hypnotism, crystal gazing, and automatic writing.
These, however, belong to a class of matter quite
different from that of spontaneous phenomena,
and are therefore not referred to, with the exception
of a single instance of crystal gazing,
which, though relating to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> was made elsewhere,
and one or two occasions of automatic<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>
writing. This latter method of inquiry displayed
all the weakness to which it is usually,
and apparently, inherently liable, and is only
mentioned here as explaining other matters.
Its chief interest was that it supplied a name
marked by a certain peculiarity which afterwards
became familiar, and that it led to a
hypothesis as to at least one of the personalities
by whom certain phenomena were professedly
caused.</p>

<p>In the afternoon an experiment was made
with the apparatus known as a <i>Ouija</i> board, and
this, as is very often the case, resolved itself,
after a time, into automatic writing. There is
in the library a portrait of a very handsome
woman, to which no name is attached, but which
shows the costume of the last century. Her
name was asked, and the word <i>Ishbel</i> was given
several times. It is not certain whether this
word was meant as an answer to the question,
or whether, as often happens in such cases,
it was intended merely as an announcement
of the name of the informant supposed to communicate.</p>

<p>The word, as given, possesses the following<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>
peculiarity. In the Gaelic language the vowels
<i>e</i> and <i>i</i> have the effect of aspirating an <i>s</i> immediately
preceding them, in the same way
in which they effect the <i>c</i> in Italian, or the <i>g</i>
in Spanish, so that, as in Italian <i>ce</i> and <i>ci</i> are
pronounced <i>chay</i> and <i>chee</i>, so in Gaelic <i>se</i> and
<i>si</i> are pronounced <i>shay</i> and <i>shee</i>. The name
Isabel is written in Gaelic <i>Iseabal</i>, but the <i>e</i>
is absorbed in its effect upon the <i>s</i> (like the <i>i</i>
in the Italian <i>c&igrave;o</i>) and the first <i>a</i> is so slurred
as to be almost inaudible, so that the word is
pronounced "Ish-bel."</p>

<p>It was obvious, therefore, that the intelligence
from which the writing proceeded (if such existed)
could write in English, and was familiar
with the colloquial Gaelic pronunciation of the
name, but was unacquainted with the Gaelic
orthography. On this occasion also the name
"Margaret" was given in its Gaelic form of
Marghearad (somewhat similarly misspelt as
<i>Marget</i>), without any special connection either
with the questions asked, or, so far as could be
discovered, with anything in the mind of any
present, none of whom had interested themselves
at that time in the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> ancestry.</p>

<p><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>In reply to questions as to what could be
done that was of use or interest, the writers
were told to go at dusk, and in silence, to the
glen in the avenue, and this, rightly or wrongly,
some of those present identified with what had
been called Scamp's Copse. They were, however,
perplexed by being told to go "up by the
burn," for though Miss Freer and Miss Moore
had twice explored the spot, they had not
observed the presence of water. The journal
continues&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>We decided to walk in the avenue, and to explore
"Scamp's Copse" before dinner, in spite of the fact that
we were expecting Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> [a barrister], Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>
[a solicitor], and Mr. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> [an accountant] just about
the time that we should be absent. Miss Moore took
the dog off in the opposite direction, and we walked in
silence to the plantation, Mr. L. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and I.
It was quite dark, but the snow gleamed so white, that we
could see our way to the plantation. We went up among
the trees, young firs; the snow was deep and untrodden;
and when we got well off the road, we found that a burn
comes down the brae side. It is frozen hard, and we found
it out only by the shining of the ice.</p>

<p>We walked on in silence to the left of the burn, up
the little valley, along a small opening between the trees
and the railing which encloses them, Mr. L. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> first,
then I, then Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>In a few minutes I saw what made me stop. The
men stopped too, and we all stood leaning over the
railings, and looking in silence across the burn to the
steep bank opposite. This was white with snow, except
to the left, where the boughs of a large oak-tree had
protected the ground.</p>

<p>Against the snow I saw a slight black figure, a woman,
moving slowly up the glen. She stopped, and turned
and looked at me. She was dressed as a nun. Her face
looked pale. I saw her hand in the folds of her habit.
Then she moved on, as it seemed, on a slope too steep
for walking. When she came under the tree she disappeared&mdash;perhaps
because there was no snow to show
her outline. Beyond the tree she reappeared for a
moment, where there was again a white background,
close by the burn. Then I saw no more. I waited, and
then, still in silence, we returned to the avenue.</p>

<p>I described what I had seen. The others saw nothing.
(This did not surprise me, for though both have been
for many years concerned in psychical investigation, and
have had unusual opportunities, neither has ever had
any "experience," so that one may conclude that they
are not by temperament likely to experience either
subjective phenomena or even thought-transference.) It
was proposed that we should ascend the glen in her
track on the other side of the burn. It was very difficult
walking, the snow very deep, and after two or three
efforts to descend the side of the bank we gave it up,
and followed to nearly her point of disappearance, keeping
above the tree, not below as she had done. We
saw no more, and returned to the house, agreeing not
to describe what had occurred, merely to say that as the<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>
factor (who looks about eighteen stone) is said not to
like the avenue at dark, we had been setting him and
others a good example.</p></div>

<br />

<p>In a letter to Lord Bute under date February
25th, Miss Freer describes this figure with some
detail:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As you know, these figures do not appear
before 6.30 at earliest, therefore there is little
light upon their surface. Like other phantasms
seen at dark, they show 'by their own light,'
<i>i.e.</i> they appear to be outlined by a thread
of light. It is therefore only when the face
appears in profile that one can describe the
features, and this is somewhat prevented by
the nun's veil. 'Ishbel' appears to me to be
slight, and of fair height. I am unable, of
course, to see the colour of her hair, but I
should describe her as dark. There is an
intensity in her gaze which is rare in light-coloured
eyes. The face, as I see it, is in
mental pain, so that it is perhaps hardly fair
to say that it seems lacking in that repose and
gentleness that one looks for in the religious
life. Her dress presents no peculiarities. The
habit is black, with the usual white about the<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>
face, and I have thought that when walking
she showed a lighter under-dress. She speaks
upon rather a high note, with a quality of
youth in her voice. Her weeping seemed to
me passionate and unrestrained."</p>

<p>The appearance of a nun was entirely
unexpected, as the name "Ishbel" had been
associated rather with the portrait of the
beautiful woman in an eighteenth-century
dress in the library, and it was she whom
the witnesses, had they expected anything
at all, would have expected to see. Miss
Freer, moreover, the first witness, had regarded
the statements of "Ouija" with her
habitual scepticism as to induced phenomena,
more particularly those of automatic writing,
in which, as in dreams, it is almost always
difficult to disentangle the operations of the
normal from those of the subconscious personality.</p>

<p>If the name "Ishbel" were really intended to
apply to the nun, it becomes a very curious
question who is the person meant. A Robert
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> married, as has been already
mentioned, Isabella <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who died in 1784,<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>
but we know of no reason for supposing that
she ever became a nun.</p>

<p>The portrait may possibly have represented
her, but it shows a much older woman than
the phantom so often seen; on the other
hand, the dates are not inconsistent, and a
considerable distance of time is suggested by
certain phrases which occurred in the automatic
writing.</p>

<p>The person to whom the mind more naturally
reverts is Miss Isabella <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the sister,
and apparently the favourite sister, of Major
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;.</span> As already mentioned, she professed
as a nun under the name of Frances Helen in
1850, and died in 1880, aged sixty-six. She
did not, therefore, enter her convent till the
age of thirty-five, an age much greater than
that shown by the phantom.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, interesting to note that
this lady's name was Isabella <i>Margaret</i>, so
that both names, as given automatically, may
have really referred to her. In the seventh
edition of "Burke's Landed Gentry," 1886,
there appears for the first time this entry&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>IV. Isabella Margaret, a nun, regular<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>
Canoness of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre,
d. 23 Feb. 1880.</i>"</p>

<p>The editors have obtained from the Nunnery,
where she lived and died, a photograph, representing
the dress of the Community, and a
description of herself, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She died 23rd February 1880, quickly, of
an attack of pneumonia or acute bronchitis.
She died a most edifying death, in perfect
consciousness, assisted by the Confessor ...
and the Community around her, and having
received the last Sacraments only a few hours
before she expired. As to her appearance, she
was short, rather fair, not at all stout, but
not extraordinarily thin.</p>

<p>"She entered the Community in April
1848, was clothed in May 1849, and professed
May 1850. We do not know whether she
could speak Gaelic. She was very fond of
Scotland, and very particular about the pronunciation
of Scotch names. She was a most
entertaining companion, being full of natural
wit."</p>

<p>The dress, which is dignified, is very peculiar
and striking, and not the least like the very<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
ordinary nun's attire in which the phantom
appeared, while it would be difficult to
imagine a greater contrast than that between
the merry old lady of the description and
the weeping girl so often seen.</p>

<p>There was, however, at least one very
peculiar reason, which will be noticed presently,
for supposing that this phantom was
really intended to represent the late Rev.
Mother Frances Helen, and that its inaccuracy
was owing to the stupid, and rather melodramatic
misconception in the mind which
originally imagined it and transferred it to
the witnesses at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p><i>February 7th, Sunday.</i>&mdash;Miss Moore was awakened this
morning soon after one o'clock by a loud reverberating<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>
bang, which seemed close to her bed. She lay awake
for a long time afterwards, but the sound was not repeated.
The men heard nothing. They report that they
went to bed soon after eleven, and very quietly.</p>

<p>My maid, who has had to give up her room, slept
downstairs last night. She was kept awake nearly all
night by noises and footsteps. The wing is not yet fit
for use, as all the pipes are frozen, and the only downstairs
bedroom was insufficiently aired; so I told her to
use that for dressing, and make herself up a bed on one
of the sitting-room sofas, and she slept (or rather, lay
awake) in the drawing-room. She was not frightened, as
she thought all the noises were made by the gentlemen;
but they declare they made no noise.</p>

<p>I asked her as to the other servants. She says the
maids are still very nervous. I spoke to them for the
first time about the noises to-day. The butler's wife has
heard sounds, but her husband only scoffs. The upper
housemaid thinks ghosts the proper thing, and tolerates
them along with the high families to which she is
accustomed. The under housemaid is very shy, is Highland,
and knows little English, and won't talk, but owns
to discomfort, and is scoffed at by the other servants, who
think it all part of her having been only a "general" till
she came here. The kitchenmaid goes home to sleep,
but I believe some one fetches her.</p>

<p>I have had a girl out of the village to make up the
linen, and she, we notice, is careful to go home before
dark.</p>

<p>This morning we all went to churches of various sorts.
When the men came in to tea they reported that they
had had a conversation with an outdoor servant, who<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>
proved to have been in the service of [Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>
father] Lord <span class="ws">D&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and was consequently the more
communicative. I know him, and have found him extremely
intelligent.</p>

<p>He says that having heard from the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s'</span> butler
(who slept on the dining-room floor, in the room my maid
is to occupy to-night) that it was impossible to sleep in a
room so noisy, he induced him to allow him to share his
room, that they heard much, but they dared not show a
light for fear of his admission being discovered (the
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> being much on the alert), and they saw nothing
[<a href="#Page_40"><i>cf.</i> p. 40</a> for evidence of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s'</span> butler].</p>

<p>We did not like to send for him on a Sunday, but
decided to have him in on Monday, and test him as to
the intensity of the noise.</p>

<p>In the evening, while we were all chatting in the
drawing-room, Miss Moore came out into the hall, where
she had been looking after the dog. In spite of the
noise we were all making, she distinctly heard the clang
noise upstairs. She had said the same thing, though with
less certainty, once before, and we agreed that one night
some one must sit up in the hall. (This was afterwards
done without result.)</p>

<p><i>February 8th, Monday.</i>&mdash;Last night my maid heard footsteps
and the sound of hands fumbling on her door; this
she told us when she came in with our early tea.</p>

<p>Miss Moore in the early morning, between one and two,
heard again the sharp, reverberating bang as before. We
speculated at breakfast as to whether the sound could
have been made by the men after we had gone upstairs,
though they were all sure of having been quite still
before midnight. We made them rehearse every sound<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>
they had in fact made, but nothing was in the least like
it, either in quality or quantity.</p>

<p>I had been disturbed about 5.30 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> by the sound
(which we had not heard hitherto) described by former
witnesses as "explosive." I know of nothing quite like
it. I have heard the Portsmouth guns when at a place
eight miles away; the sound was like that, but did not
convey the same impression of distance. I heard it, at
intervals, during half-an-hour. Miss Moore is a very
light sleeper, but she did not awake. At six I got up
and went through my room to the dressing-room door
(No. 6), after a sound that seemed especially near. It
was so near, that though I thought it quite unlikely
under the circumstances, I wanted to satisfy myself that
no one was playing jokes on Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> whose room was
close by. The house was deadly still. I could hear the
clocks ticking on the stairs. As I stood, the sound came
again. It might have been caused by a very heavy fall
of snow from a high roof&mdash;not sliding, but percussive.
Miss Moore had wakened up and heard it too.</p>

<p>(<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;We afterwards found that, as the roof is flat, the
snow is cleared away daily.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;,</span> an utter sceptic, he declares, left early;
then we all went for a walk. We spent the whole afternoon
making experiments. Miss Moore or my maid or I,
as having heard the noises, shut ourselves up in the room
whence they were heard, or stood in the right places on
hall or staircase.</p>

<p>The experimental noises made were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Banging with poker or shovel as hard as possible on
every part of the big iron stove in the hall; kicking it,
hitting it with sticks (as Miss Moore and I persisted<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>
that the first noise was as of metal on wood, or <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>).</p>

<p>2. Trampling and banging in every part of the house,
obvious and obscure, in cupboards and cistern holes.</p>

<p>3. (On the hypothesis of tricks from outside.) Beating
on outside doors with shovels and pokers and wooden
things, on the walls and windows accessible; banging and
clattering in outside coal-cellars and in the sunk area
round the house. (<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Beating on the front door
handle with a wooden racket, was right in kind, but not
nearly enough in degree.)</p>

<p>Miss Moore, who was familiar with the noise, did it rather
well by going into a coal-cellar (always locked at night,
however) outside and throwing big lumps of coal, from a
distance, into a big pail, but <i>it wasn't nearly loud enough</i>.</p>

<p>4. Finally the men climbed on to the roof, outside,
while Miss Moore and I shut ourselves into the proper
places. They clattered and walked and stamped and kicked
and struck the slates, but <i>they couldn't make noise enough</i>.</p>

<p>Then we had in the gardener they saw yesterday, and
put him in the butler's room, and the four men made
hideous rows as before. He was grateful and respectful,
but contemptuous. <i>They couldn't make noise enough.</i></p>

<p>We went out at dusk, having sent Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> to pay a visit (as they had not been told of the
brook scene), intending that the same trio as before
should go to the copse. Mr. <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> couldn't come,
and as Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> and I went on alone, we met Mr.
<span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> returning before they were
expected. On the spur of the moment I asked Mr.
<span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> to come with me, leaving Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mr.
<span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> in the avenue. The snow had gone, and I<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>
saw less distinctly; but I saw the nun again, and an older
woman in grey, who talked earnestly with her, she
answering at intervals. I could hear no words; the ice
was giving, and the burn had begun to murmur. (I tried
to persuade myself that the murmur accounted for the
voices, but the sounds were entirely distinct, and different
in quality and amount.)</p></div>

<br />

<p>This older woman in grey afterwards became
familiar. The name "Marget" was given
to her at first half in fun and simply because
this was one of the two names given by Ouija
(<i>cf.</i> p. 98). She is apparently the grey woman
referred to in the paper published by Mrs.
<span class="ws">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> (<a href="#Page_64"><i>cf.</i> p. 64</a>).</p>

<p>The fact of voices being heard by two persons,
while one alone saw the figures, seems a
clear proof that the figures were hallucinatory.
It seems probable that the sounds also were
hallucinatory, but were what is called in the
vocabulary of the S.P.R. the "collective" hallucination
of two persons. This seems to render
it highly probable that in the case of each the
hallucination had a cause external to both,
although common to both; moreover, hallucinations
are often contagious. <i>The Times</i> correspondent
states, that "the lady admitted that<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
the apparition was purely subjective, but in
regard to other matters was not willing to
suppose that she might be the victim of
hallucinations of hearing as well as of sight."
On the contrary, as all readers of Miss Freer's
published works are aware, she is entirely of
opinion that such sights and sounds are pure
sense-hallucinations, whatever may be their
ultimate origin.</p>

<div class="block"><p>We rejoined the others in silence. Then Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span>
said to Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> "Did you see anything?" "Nothing;
I only heard voices." "What sort of voices?" "Two
women. The older voice talked most, almost continuously.
I heard a younger voice, a higher one, now and then."</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Note by Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span>.</i></p>

<p>"I knew previously, though Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> did not, that
Miss Freer had seen something up the burn; and when
waiting for her and Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, <span class="ws">Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;</span> told me the
whole story."</p>
<br />
<p><a name="feb9" id="feb9"></a><i>February 9th, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Last night we&mdash;Miss Moore and
I&mdash;heard the "explosive" noises about 11.30 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, and
speculated as to the possibility of their being caused by
the wind in the chimney. There was a little wind last
night&mdash;very little. It is worth mentioning, that ever
since we have been here the air has been phenomenally
still. One can go outside, as we do frequently, to feed
the birds and squirrels without hats and not feel a<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
hair stirred. Even when the snow was on the ground
we never felt the cold, owing to the absence of wind,
and the thaw has been imperceptible. Snow is still on
the hills. I have several times thrown open my bedroom
window about dawn for an hour to familiarise myself
with the outside noises. There is nothing human within
a quarter of a mile. (<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The others, who are much
more likely to be accurate as to distance than I, say
the lodges are farther off.) The servants' houses are in
a group of buildings on the hill above the house, but
are, I believe, all empty. We found, and adopted, a
deserted cat, whose condition certainly testified to the
nakedness of the land. There are two inhabited lodges
far out of hearing. A gardener comes round to the
houses about 10 or 10.30 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, but we have watched
him, and know exactly what sounds he creates.</p>

<p><i>February 10th, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> arrived this
morning from London; also Miss Langton, who is "sensitive,"
but wholly inexperienced. In the evening, at 6 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>,
Colonel Taylor arrived. He is in No. 8.</p>

<p>Miss Moore and I moved back into No. 1, and moved
Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> into No. 3, the room reported (by the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span>)
as specially haunted, where Colonel <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Major
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> had slept, and in our time Mr. <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who
left last night.</p>

<p>The wing is now ready for habitation, except that the
pipes are out of order, and the "set-basins" useless,
also the bath. (<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The fact that the pipes are all
out of working order, and not a drop of hot water is to be
had except in the kitchen, does away with a theory, which
has been rather emphatically put forward, that "it is all
the hot-water pipes.")</p>

<p><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>We are anxious to test the wing. Only one story, Miss
<span class="ws">"B&mdash;&mdash;'s,"</span> is connected with it, and if there has been any
practical joking anywhere, I personally incline to think
that was the occasion. The wing is new, built, they say,
in 1883, and the "ghost" showed human intelligence in
selection of doors and victims. (After my return to London
I had a conversation with Mrs. <span class="ws">G&mdash;&mdash;,</span> which convinced
me that I was mistaken in supposing that tricks had been
played upon Miss <span class="ws">"B&mdash;&mdash;."</span> <a href="#Page_71">See p. 71.</a>)</p>

<p>An old woman in the village asked Miss Moore to-day
with interest, "Hoo'll ye be liking <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>?" She spoke
of the hauntings, and her husband insisted (the Highlander
always begins that way) that there were not any, and so
on, and the old woman explained that it was just the young
gentlemen last year that was having a lark. Later she admitted,
"There's nae ghaists at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> but the old Major"
(who died about twenty years ago); "he'd just be saying
to Gracie if she didn't do as she was told, that he'd be
coming back and belay the decks" (<i>cf.</i> p. 136).</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;<i>Monday 15th.</i>&mdash;In the kirkyard to-day at <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> we
were shown the Major's grave. It is one of three, inclosed by
a rough stone wall. They have no headstones, and seem quite
uncared for. One is, we are informed, that of his housekeeper,
Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;.</span> The other is said to be that of a black
man-servant.</p>

<p>Last night we slept as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>Miss Moore lay awake nearly the whole night. She heard,
though in less degree, the old noises; and in the early
morning (compare our first night) heard the sound of
women's voices talking. When I awoke, about 6 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>,
she told me she had been disturbed, and said she feared
that the others had also, as she had heard Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span>
talking in Miss Langton's room.</p>

<p>At breakfast Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> reported that she had been
awakened by knockings, but had never moved. Miss
Langton had heard nothing.</p>

<p>The Colonel reported that about, or just before, six he
had heard footsteps over his head. There is no room
over No. 8, which is mostly a built-out bow, and the
servants had not moved before 6.30. (If they moved
then, it was contrary to their habits!) We heard later
that Hannah had gone, about 6.30, "in her stocking-feet,
only without her stockings," to ask the time at the cook's
door.</p>

<p>The Colonel (before our inquiries) had imitated the
noise by stamping heavily with striding steps across the
library.</p>

<p><i>February 11th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;The Colonel moved down
into "Miss <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> room" in the wing, and Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span>
into the room next to him.</p>

<p><i>February 12th, Friday.</i>&mdash;No phenomena. The great
business to-day, which we had specially reserved for
the Colonel's arrival, was the making of sketches and
measurements for the plan of the house. We found no
mysteries. The walls are immensely thick, but all the
space is accounted for.</p>

<p><i>February 13th, Saturday.</i>&mdash;Miss Moore slept very badly
again last night. She heard the noises at intervals<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>
between three and five; she was awake before and after.
They were loudest and most frequent after four. At 5.30
I was awakened by a loud crash as of something falling
very heavily on the floor above. The maids sleep there,
but can give no account of any fall. Miss Moore, of
course, heard it as, and when, I did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> reports having heard loud raps. She
thinks the noise may have wakened her, but after she
was awake enough to get a light and look at her watch
(3.40) she heard what she describes as "a double knock."</p>

<p><i>February 14th, Sunday.</i>&mdash;Our first wet day. The weather
so far has been perfect. We all got very wet coming
from church.</p>

<p>In the evening we did various experiments&mdash;thought-transference,
crystal gazing, &amp;c.&mdash;but nothing came of it
in regard to the house.</p>

<p><i>February 15th, Monday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> left early.</p>

<p>We all walked to the Parish Church, and had some
talk with the sexton, and I had to listen to long yarns
about the Major (see under date <a href="#feb9">February 9th</a>). I was
tired, and could not go to the copse.</p>

<p>In the evening we played games, and were very lively.
Miss Langton came into my room for a few minutes, and
was certainly not in any nervous condition, nor did we
speak of the hauntings. But this morning (Tuesday) at
breakfast she reported having heard a loud crash almost
directly after getting to her room. We considered possible
causes, but could not discover that any one was moving
in the house. The servants had gone to bed some time
earlier, and we had put out the lights ourselves in the
hall and on the stairs.</p>

<p><i>February 16th, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I had an experience this<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>
morning which may have been purely subjective, but
which should be recorded. About 10 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> I was writing
in the library, face to light, back to fire. Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span>
was in the room, and addressed me once or twice; but I
was aware of not being responsive, as I was much occupied.
I wrote on, and presently felt a distinct, but gentle, push
against my chair. I thought it was the dog and looked
down, but he was not there. I went on writing, and in
a few minutes felt a push, firm and decided, against
myself which moved me on my chair. I thought it was
Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who, having spoken and obtained no answer,
was reminding me of her presence. I looked backward
with an exclamation&mdash;the room was empty. She came
in directly, and called my attention to the dog, who was
gazing intently from the hearthrug at the place where
I had expected (before) to see him.</p>

<p>As the day began with the above, and I had had a
quiet rest, I went to the copse at dusk. The moon was
bright, and the twilight lingered. We waited about in
the avenue to let it get darker, but it was still far from
dark when we made our way up the glen&mdash;Miss Moore,
Miss Langton, and myself.</p>

<p>I saw "Ishbel" and "Marget" in the old spot across
the burn. "Ishbel" was on her knees in the attitude
of weeping, "Marget" apparently reasoning with her in
a low voice, to which "Ishbel" replied very occasionally.
I could not hear what was said for the noise of the burn.
We waited for perhaps ten or fifteen minutes. They had
appeared when I had been there perhaps three or four.</p>

<p>When we regained the avenue (in silence) Miss Moore
asked Miss Langton, "What did you see?" (She had been
told nothing, except that the Colonel, who did not know<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>
details then, had said in her presence something about
"a couple of nuns".) She said, "I saw nothing, but I
heard a low talking." Questioned further, she said it
seemed close behind. The glen is so narrow, that this
might be quite consistent with what I saw and heard.
Miss Moore heard a murmuring voice, and is quite certain
it was not the burn. She is less suggestible than almost
any one I know.</p>

<p>The dog ran up while we were there, pointed, and ran
straight for the two women. He afterwards left us, and
we found him barking in the glen. He is a dog who
hardly ever barks. We went up among the trees where
he was, and could find no cause.</p>

<p>Miss Moore and I moved into No. 8 (dressing-room
No. 6). It is a "suspect" room, which I had not tried,
and Miss Moore had scarcely slept all the week in No. 1,
and was looking so worn out, that I decided to move.</p>

<p><i>February 17th, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;A most glorious day, still,
bright, and sunny.</p>

<p>Nothing happened till evening. The Colonel, Mrs.
<span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Miss Langton, Miss Moore, and I were in the
drawing-room after dinner. Some of us, certainly the
last four, heard footsteps overhead in No. 1, which is just
now disused. I was lying on the sofa, and could not
get up quickly: but Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Miss Langton ran
up at once, and found it empty and dark, and no one
about.</p>

<p>Later, about 10.30, we all five heard the clang noise with
which some of us are so familiar. The servants had gone
to bed&mdash;or so we presumed, as all lights were out, except
on the upper floor. It occurred four times. It is of
course conceivable they may have made it, but we do<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>
not hear it when we know them to be about, and we do
hear it when we know them not to be about.</p>

<p>The following quotation is from Miss Langton's private
diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the night of Wednesday, February 17th, I had a
curious dream or vision. I seemed to be standing outside
the door of No. 4, looking up the corridor to No. 2,
when suddenly I saw a figure with his back to the door
of No. 2, and quite close to the door which leads to No. 3.
His face was quite distinct, and what struck me most was
the curious way in which his hair grew on his temples.
His eyes were very dark, keen, and deep-set; his face was
pale, and with a drawn, haggard expression. He looked
about thirty-nine years of age. His hair was dark and
thick, and waved back from his forehead, where it was
slightly grey. It was a most interesting and clever face,
and one that would always, I should think, attract attention.
He was dressed in a long black gown like a cassock,
only with a short cape, barely reaching to the elbows."</p>

<p>A further reference to this vision, which at the time
seemed irrelevant, will be found on page 225.</p>

<p><i>February 18th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;This morning's phenomenon
is the most incomprehensible I have yet known. I heard
the banging sounds after we were in bed last night.
Early this morning, about 5.30, I was awakened by them.
They continued for nearly an hour. Then another sound
began <i>in</i> the room. It might have been made by a very
lively kitten jumping and pouncing, or even by a very
large bird; there was a fluttering noise too. It was
close, exactly opposite the bed. Miss Moore woke up,
and we heard it going on till nearly eight o'clock. I
drew up the blinds and opened the window wide. I<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>
sought all over the room, looking into cupboards and
under furniture. We cannot guess at any possible
explanation.</p></div>

<br />

<p>Further experience of these curious hallucinatory
sounds, combined with visual hallucination
in the same room, taking also into
consideration the interest which our own dogs
always displayed in these phenomena, led us to
the conclusion that our first deductions had been
wrong, and that the sounds were those of a dog
gambolling.</p>

<div class="block"><p>(The Rev.) Mr. "Q." (an English vicar), arrived. In
the evening, at 6.30, Miss Langton and I took him down
to the glen. It was a very light evening. I saw the
figure of Ishbel, not very distinctly, in conversation with
the second figure, which was barely defined. We remained
in perfect silence as usual. On regaining the
avenue Miss <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> said she had heard voices, and
thought she had seen what might be the white parts of
the nun's dress. Mr. "Q." said he had seen a light
under the big tree. The figures were nearer the tree
than usual. Miss Langton went up a second time with
the Colonel, and again heard voices.</p></div>

<br />

<p>It is worth remarking that Mr. "Q." has,
doubtless from some idiosyncrasy, since developed
a faculty of seeing lights where other
people see phantasms.</p>

<p><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></p>

<div class="block"><p><i>February 19th, Friday.</i>&mdash;No phenomena last night. We
have spent the day in <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the neighbouring town,
where I had a fall and hurt my foot, so that I was
obliged to drive home, and could not go to the glen.
Miss Langton and Mr. "Q." went down about seven o'clock.
Mr. "Q." saw the outline of a figure of which he has
written the description. Miss Langton heard the usual
voices on the other side of the burn; they seemed to her
to be interrupted by a third voice, in deeper tones; and
she also heard the footsteps of a man passing behind her,
a heavy tread, "not like a gentleman."</p></div>

<br />

<p>The following, the account referred to, was
contained in a private letter from Mr. "Q." to
Lord Bute. The description of Ishbel in the
Journal of February 26th, was, it will be observed,
of later date, although before Miss Freer
had seen the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>February 19th and 20th, 1897.</i>&mdash;I had heard
only that Miss Freer had seen two figures by the
burn, one of which was that of a nun, the other
a woman, before whom, on one occasion, the nun
appeared to be kneeling. I had always pictured
the nun as standing or kneeling with her back
to the spectator.</p>

<p>"On February 19th, at about 6.45 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, I
visited the burn with Miss Langton (<i>and not
Miss Freer</i>). After looking a little I saw<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>
(<i>a</i>); the white was very plain, and the head
clearly outlined, but the vision was for the fraction
of a second. I was conscious of it indistinctly
for a few minutes, and there seemed a good deal
of movement. Suddenly I was again conscious
of the figure as shown in (<i>b</i>), full-face, as though
gazing at me; again the white part was very
distinct, but I could distinguish no features."</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>February 20th, Saturday.</i>&mdash;This morning we went down
to <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and had a little talk with the old servant who
told us stories the other day about the Major, and she
repeated the story of his threatened return. The same
story was repeated independently this afternoon by [a
local tradesman], who opened conversation by inquiring
whether we had "seen the Major yet."</p>

<p>Miss Moore and I again this morning heard noises in
No. 8, more especially those of the pattering footsteps,
just after daylight, and a violent jump and scramble,
which we thought was our dog, until we found that he
was sleeping peacefully as usual on his rug at our feet.</p></div>

<br />

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>In a letter to Lord Bute, dated February 21,
1897, Mr "Q." gives the following account:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On February 20th, at about 6.45 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, I
visited the burn with Miss Freer and Miss Langton.
I was very briefly conscious of the figure (<i>a</i>) on
the bank of the burn, but saw no more till Miss
Freer pointed to the hollow of a large tree, when
I again saw (<i>b</i>). On each occasion of seeing (<i>b</i>)
a curious sensation was noticeable, and I felt
I was being looked at. On speaking afterwards
to Miss Freer, I found her vision of the nun
<i>under the tree</i> to be the same as mine at (<i>b</i>),
<i>i.e.</i> full face, as indeed Miss Freer had seen it
on previous occasions. This is the second sketch
I have drawn of the full face (<i>b</i>). The first I
showed to Miss Freer, remarking to her, 'I have
made the figure <i>too broad</i>' (being unaccustomed
to drawing). 'Yes,' said Miss Freer, 'for the
nun is very slight.'"</p>

<p>It was seen at the same moment also by
Miss Freer and Miss Langton.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>February 21st, Sunday.</i>&mdash;Again this morning we heard
noises of pattering in No. 8, and Scamp got up and sat
apparently watching something invisible to us, turning his
head slowly as if following the movements of some person
or thing across the room from west to east. During the<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
night Miss Moore had heard footsteps crossing the room,
as of an old or invalid man shuffling in slippers. We both
heard a bang at the side of the room about 6.20, some
time before any sounds of moving were heard from the
servants above. The noise was muffled in quality, and
had no resonance, and seemed to come from behind a
small wardrobe on the east wall. The room (No. 7) on
that side was unoccupied. [This bang was heard at other
times in the same spot. Experiment showed that no
noise made in No. 7 was audible in No. 8, not even
hammering with a poker on the wall, which is curved
at this point.]</p>

<p>This morning, on coming out of church, I received a
letter from Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> in which was the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who slept, I believe, in the room
occupied by you when I left, heard sounds of footsteps
going round her room, footsteps with the most unmistakable
limp in them. Shortly after she heard stories connected
with the former owner, who used to go by the
name of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> an aged man [the Major]. She asked if
he could be described. 'No,' said her informant; 'the
only thing he could remember about him was that he had
a most peculiar limp,' and he forthwith gave an exhibition,
which tallied exactly with the limp around the bed."</p>

<p>In discussing this, Miss Moore and I agreed that, had
Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> slept in No. 8 instead of in No. 1, as Mr.
<span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> supposed, we should have considered these limping
sounds as probably identical with those we ourselves had
heard. After I had closed my reply to Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Miss
Moore discovered Miss <span class="ws">"B&mdash;&mdash;'s"</span> plan of the house (in
the packet of evidence of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s'</span> tenancy, <a href="#Page_96">see p. 96</a>),<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>
which showed that in fact No. 8 <i>was</i> the room referred to.
Hence it appears that the room in which Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> heard
the footsteps was the same as that in which <i>we</i> heard them.
We had been misled by Mr. <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;</span> speaking of "the room
you occupied when I left," a mistake on his part, as, though
the change had been spoken of, we had not left No. 1.</p>

<p>This afternoon Miss Langton experimented with Ouija
at Mr. "Q.'s" request.</p></div>

<br />

<p>Lord Bute had suggested various test-questions
in relation to the phantasm of the nun, to
be asked the next time the Ouija board was in
operation, and answers to these were attempted
at various times, with the usual result of showing
the influence, conscious or sub-conscious, of the
sitters, almost all statements as to matters not
actually known to them being worthless. On
this occasion, however, in reply to the question,
"How old was Ishbel when she died?" answers
were spelt out to the effect that she was still
living, and that her age was fifty-nine.</p>

<p>This may perhaps be taken as throwing light
upon the intended personality of Ishbel, and
supplying a possible clue to the identity of the
mind of which she seems to be an imaginary
creation.</p>

<p>Fifty-nine was the age of the late Rev.<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>
Mother Frances Helen in the year 1873, when
Sarah <span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;</span> died. They are not people who
are at all likely to have met each other upon
"the other side" any more than upon this.</p>

<p>It is a generally recognised fact that the conditions
which we call "time and space" exist
on in the world beyond in a form so very different
from those in which they are conceived of
by us, that from our point of view they can
hardly be said to exist at all. It is natural,
therefore, to seek the utterer of this remarkable
statement in some person connected with <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
who did not know the late Mother Frances Helen
(supposing her to be the person for whom Ishbel
was intended), but had heard of her.</p>

<div class="block">
<p><i>February 22nd, Monday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">"Z&mdash;&mdash;"</span> <i>came</i>.</p>
</div>

<br />

<p>The whole matter of the inquiry had been
made known to Mr. <span class="ws">"Z&mdash;&mdash;,"</span> the proprietor
of a prominent Scottish newspaper, of course
in the strictest confidence, which was carefully
made a condition of the admission of any
one to the house, a confidence which he most
honourably observed. It was arranged that
if anything occurred within the observation of
himself or his son, the scientific value of which<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>
rendered it, in their judgment, desirable to
publish a notice of it in <i>The <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span></i>, the notice
should be published under avowedly false names
and geographical indications. Mr. <span class="ws">"Z&mdash;&mdash;"</span>
was unable to come himself, but his son arrived
this day.</p>

<div class="block"><p>Mr. "Endell" (a Member of the S.P.R.) arrived while
we were out, and made a tour of inspection alone of the
outside of the house and the ground-floor rooms. He
intuitively fixed on the window of No. 3 as that of a
"haunted" room, and has since, equally by intuition,
diagnosed the drawing-room and library as "creepy," and
the dining-room as definitely cheerful. (This coincides
with our experience.)</p>

<p>My own experiences to-day were confined to ejection
from a high waggonette, while waiting at the station for
Mr. <span class="ws">"Z&mdash;&mdash;,"</span> the horse having bolted at the appearance of
the train.</p>

<p>No phenomena. We are putting Mr. <span class="ws">"Z&mdash;&mdash;",</span> at his
own request, in No. 3, the "ghost-room."</p>

<p><i>February 23rd, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Pouring wet. No phenomena.
Visit to glen impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. <span class="ws">R&mdash;&mdash;</span> (local residents) came to lunch.
Though in great pain I was able to see them for a few
minutes, and both inquired whether we had had any
experience of the reported hauntings, of which, however,
they could give us no details.</p>

<p><i>February 24th, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">"Z&mdash;&mdash;"</span> left early.
(<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;No phenomena reported by any one during his
visit; he himself slept soundly in the "haunted" room,<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>
but does it the justice to acknowledge that he "could
sleep through an earthquake.")</p>

<p>Miss "N." (the daughter of a landowner of the district)
arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. Garford (an old friend and excellent observer)
came from London. We sleep to-night as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the wing, in the two rooms alleged by guests of
the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> to be haunted, the Colonel and Mr. "Endell."</p>

<p><i>February 25th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;Mr. "Endell" reported this
morning having heard a sound he could in no way account
for, which seems to us to correspond with the "clanging"
noise. We asked how he would imitate it as to volume
and quality, and he said that a large iron kettle, about
the size of the dinner-table (we are dining eight), boiling
violently, so that the lid was constantly "wobbling," might
produce it.</p>

<p>(<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Mr. "Endell's" opinion later is that a pavior's
crowbar heavily dropped, so as to produce a prolonged
reverberation, is a better illustration.)</p>

<p>Mr. Garford, who was not told that any sounds might
be expected in No. 1, says he was awakened by a
violent banging at the door of communication between
Nos. 1 and 2 (No. 2 is empty). Mr. "Endell," Mr. "Q.,"
and Miss Moore went up later in the day to experiment<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
on the door, and found that it would <i>open</i> with the slightest
push. Mr. Garford had closed it on going to bed, and
found it closed in the morning. He had not been alarmed,
and had almost called out to his supposed visitors, before
he remembered supernormal possibilities. He described
the sound as a muffled bang, and in order to reproduce it
to his satisfaction one of the party held a thick rug on
the inner side while another hammered on the panels
without.</p>

<p>Mr. "Q.'s" experiences in No. 3 will be reported by
himself. The groans which he heard coming from No. 2
some of our party suggested might have been made in
sleep by the occupant of No. 1, but on trying experiments
it was found that no sounds of the kind which he could
make in his room were audible in No. 3.</p>

<p>Mr. "Q." left.</p>

<p>Miss Langton went up the glen with Mr. Garford,
and was perplexed by seeing the grey figure when looking
for the nun; she saw it but dimly, but later in the
evening recovered it in the crystal, more clearly and in
greater detail.</p></div>

<br />

<p>The following is Mr. "Q.'s" account of
his experience, written on February 24th and
March 4th, in private letters to Lord Bute, but,
in order to avoid the possibility of suggestion
to others, not contributed at the time to this
journal. The Editors have been permitted also
to read another account written by Mr. "Q." of
this and of his subsequent experience, written<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>
immediately after the occasion, which agrees with
his letters to Lord Bute in every particular.</p>

<p>"<i>February 24th, 1897.</i>&mdash;I slept in room No. 3.
I knew it had a 'bad' reputation, also
I had heard through Ouija of probable appearances
and noises at 3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> and 4.30 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> I
noted the time of retiring in passing the clock
on the staircase, <i>i.e.</i> 12.10.</p>

<p>"Before going to bed I sat in a chair with my
back to a small mahogany cupboard, placed
against the wall of the dressing-room, into which
my room (No. 3) opens. About 1 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> I was
much startled at hearing behind me very distinctly
a loud groan, coming, apparently, from
the dressing-room, in the direction of the mahogany
cupboard. The sound was very distinct,
and but for the fact of there being no one visible,
I should have estimated its origin as <i>in</i> the room,
its distinctness being such that, coming from the
next room, with the door closed, it would have
sounded slightly muffled. So distinct was it
that I heard what I can only describe as the
throat vibration in the tone.</p>

<p>"I tried to ascribe it to the bubbling of the
hot-water pipe of a washing basin fixed in the<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>
dressing-room, as I supposed, against the wall
of the bedroom, but saw next day that the
basin in question was fixed against the opposite
wall of the dressing-room.</p>

<div class="img" style="width: 60%;">
<a href="images/imagep131.jpg">
<img border="0" src="images/imagep131.jpg" width="55%" alt="Cupboard, Chair, Washing-stand." /></a><br />
<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em;">A, Cupboard. &nbsp; B, Chair. &nbsp; C, Washing-stand (fixed).</p>
</div>

<p>"The sound was a greatly magnified and
humanised edition of what I have several times
heard in the drawing-room below the dressing-room,
and which has been heard by several of
the party together."</p>

<p>And in a letter dated March 4.&mdash;"I went
upstairs at 12.10. On shutting the door of my
room I experienced a curiously cold sensation.<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
I stood by the fire, which was burning brightly,
and shivered to an extent that was quite phenomenal;
the fire did not in the least remove
the cold shudderings which ran from head
to feet.</p>

<p>"I threw the feeling off as best I could, but not
entirely. I read a little and then prayed. I
read the office of compline and my private
prayers, and praying according to my custom
for all faithful departed, and especially for those
who had previously lived in the house or been
connected with it. After this I looked at my
watch; it was just upon one o'clock, and I sat
for a few minutes in the chair by the fire, when
I heard the noise described, behind me.</p>

<p>"I changed my position and placed the chair
with its back to a table and facing the door, the
candle on the table, and took a book and read;
my shuddering sensations had been worse than
ever. Suddenly I looked up, and above the bed,
<i>apparently</i> on the wall, I got just a glimpse
(like a flash) of a brown wood crucifix: the wall
was quite bare, not a picture, nothing to make
it explainable by imperfect light or reflection.
From that time the sensation of cold and<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
shuddering went away: I don't say immediately,
but I was quite conscious of being
reassured.</p>

<p>"About half-an-hour afterwards all feeling of
distress of any sort had gone. I went to bed
and to sleep. My own idea now is, that the
sound I heard was an inarticulate cry for help,
probably by means of prayer. The influence I
feel was <i>bad</i>, but something overcame it."</p>

<p>It is desirable to add, as a question of evidence,
for comparison of the dates of this and
Miss Freer's subsequent account of the same
phenomenon, that a letter from Mr. "Q." in
Lord Bute's possession, dated March 16th,
begins, "I have no objection to Miss Freer
seeing my letter on the subject of the
crucifix...."</p>

<p>Mr. "Q." also states that his delay in
writing to Lord Bute about the crucifix was,
that he thought it might be a mental reproduction
of one which he sometimes sees in his
own home, but that he found on examining the
latter that it has a white figure, whereas that of
the apparition has the figure of the same brown
wood as the cross. In the private account<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>
above referred to Mr. "Q" writes, "I found
that the crucifix at home <i>in no way</i> resembles
what I saw at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;".</span> It will be remarked that
this peculiar apparition was seen in the same
room by the Rev. P. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> in August 1892
(<a href="#Page_17">see p. 17</a>), and it was again seen on March 6th
by Miss Freer, who had not heard at all of his
experiences, and only a bare mention, without
detail or description, of that of Mr. "Q." A
fourth vision in this connection&mdash;that of Miss
Langton, who had heard of none of the other
three, is described under date March 19.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>February 26th, Friday.</i>&mdash;Nothing happened till I was
in the drawing-room in the evening, when I was, as usual
since my accident, taking my meal alone. A screen stood
between my sofa and the door, so that it was impossible
to see who entered. I saw the shadow of a woman on
the wall, and supposed it to be a maid come to see after
the fire. Next, the figure of an old woman emerged from
behind the screen; she was of average height, and stout;
she wore a woollen cap, and her dress was that of a
superior servant indoors. Supposing her to be some
servant's visitor come to have a look at the drawing-room
while the party were at dinner, I moved to attract
her attention, with no result. She walked a few steps
towards the middle of the room, then disappeared. Her
countenance was not pleasing, but expressed no personal
malevolence; her face may have been coarsely handsome.<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>
Her dress was dark, and made in the fashion which was
worn in my childhood. When the dog came in later he
seemed to sight something from behind the screen and
followed it across the room, when he lay down under
my couch, instead of on the hearth as usual. He had
done the same thing yesterday morning, looking much
frightened, and had then taken refuge under Miss
Langton's chair.</p></div>

<br />

<p>In connection with this it will be seen elsewhere
that footsteps were constantly heard in
the drawing-room, both at night and in daylight.</p>

<div class="block"><p>Mr. Garford, in No. 1, heard last night what seemed
like the detonating noise, which he describes as like a
wheelbarrow on a hard road, "a sharp, rapidly repeated
knocking," at a distance.</p>

<p><i>February 27th, Saturday.</i>&mdash;Colonel <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mr.

<p>The glen was visited by Colonel <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mr.
<span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;,</span> escorted by Miss Langton.</p>

<p><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><i>February 28th, Sunday.</i>&mdash;All slept well. I assisted Miss
Langton with some Ouija experiments in the presence
of, first, Mr. "Endell," then Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;,</span> then of
Colonel <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Miss "N."</p>

<p><i>March 1st, Monday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> reported at breakfast
that he had awakened at 5.45, and almost immediately
heard a loud clanging sound in the north-west
corner of his room; he was fully awake, struck a light, saw
nothing, and looked at his watch. We tried later to reproduce
this noise, which he described as resembling a
loud blow upon a washhand basin. I shut myself into
No. 1, and found this a fair, but too faint, imitation of the
sounds Miss Moore and I had heard there.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> left.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> and the Colonel have to-day had some
talk with <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> [who had an intimate knowledge of the
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family. See under dates Feb. 9th and 20th]. She
repeated her former story of the Major's promised "return,"
especially a statement made to an old woman who worked
in the garden, who had told him that at least "he'd no get
in there, she'd keep the gate locked," that he "would come
in below the deck" (<i>cf.</i> p. 114). He was described as a
short, broad man, with white hair and beard, "a'ful fond
o' dogs (of which he had many), and so noisy with them
in the morning, that when he and his housekeeper-body
let them out, his voice could be heard on the hill." She
also said that on Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> return from India to
assume the property he found a tenant in possession, and
had built himself a small house beyond the grounds,
which he afterwards let with the shooting. In the late
Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> time this house was used as a retreat during
the summer for nuns (a statement which interests us<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>
greatly, as affording a possible clue to the apparition).</p>

<p>The Major was greatly attached to the place, and had a
great dislike to the presence of strangers in it, or to its
going out of the old name. The estate, we hear, was
much encumbered when he succeeded to it, but he
cleared off all debts in a few years, and appears to have
lived a somewhat eccentric and recluse life, in the society
of his dogs and dependants.</p></div>

<br />

<p>This is the first mention of the fact that nuns
had ever lived at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Miss Freer had not
been aware that the object of the Rev. P.
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> visit in 1892 had been to give what
is called a Spiritual Retreat to those who had
been occupying the cottage. It is only fair to
suggest that the phantasmal nun, to whom the
name Ishbel had been given, may really have
been the phantasm of one of these visitors, and
that the dress of at least some of them was
identical with or closely resembled hers, while
it was totally unlike that worn by the community
to which the late Mother Frances Helen
belonged. At the same time, Ishbel's dress was
of a kind so very common among nuns, that it
would have been that with which she would,
most naturally, have been clothed by the<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
imagination of any one unacquainted with the very
rare Order to which Mother Frances Helen belonged.
To make further investigation into the
history of all the Sisters who ever stayed at
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> through the kindness of the late Mr.
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> would have been a task impossible for
its vastness, and almost certainly futile through
the natural reticence of their communities with
regard to any matters likely to occasion
haunting.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>March 1st (continued), Monday.</i>&mdash;I went up the burn
for the first time since my accident on Saturday, February
20th. We had had a promise from Ouija on Sunday that
if Mr. "Endell" were to visit the copse with me after 6.30
he would be touched on the left shoulder. He was told
to go to the farther side of the burn, and to stand under
the sapling, which is at some little distance from the spot
where the phantasm usually appears. This we accordingly
did. I was barely able in the dusk to distinguish the
figure from my post on the west bank, but the phantasm
appeared very near him, as I could distinguish the white
pocket-handkerchief in his breast pocket. I saw her
hand approach this, but could not positively say that it
touched him. Mr. "Endell" saw nothing, and could not
positively say that he felt a touch, though conscious of a
sense of sudden chill, and agreed with me that had he
certainly felt one, he would probably have considered it
the effect of expectation. We stood there for perhaps ten
minutes, and he was for a short time conscious of the<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>
subjective sensations which he commonly feels in the presence
of phenomena. We returned simultaneously to the avenue,
where we discussed the occurrence and the possibilities
of making it evidential. The only thing we could think
of was to send for Miss Langton, and without telling her
anything of what we had seen or expected, ascertain
whether she saw the phantasm in its usual position (high
up on the bank), or a good deal farther to the left, and
nearer the burn, as I had done. By the time she arrived
it was much darker, but she saw the figure under the
tree by the brook, and described it as "kneeling." She
has better sight than I, and believed it to be behind
Mr. "Endell." I should have judged her to be crouching
or stooping in front of him, but judging from comparison
of our normal sight, she is much more likely to be
accurate than I.</p></div>

<br />

<p>Mr. "Endell's" separately recorded account,
dated March 5, exactly agrees with this, but
adds some additional touches to the latter part.</p>

<p>"At Miss Freer's suggestion, I fetched Miss
Langton, telling her nothing of what had
occurred, but merely that we were trying an
experiment, and she was to report what she saw.</p>

<p>"I stood again under the sapling. This time
I began to shudder almost immediately. It
was so dark they told me that they could only
see my collar though I was only ten yards from
them.</p>

<p><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>"Miss Langton said that thirty seconds after
I had taken up my position, the figure appeared
behind me a little to my left, and seemed to
raise its arm. Miss Freer said it was waiting
for me, and touched me as before.</p>

<p>"I felt no touch throughout, only shiverings
that seemed to coincide with appearances."</p>

<div class="block"><p>To-night Miss "N." wishes to sleep in No. 3, and
Miss Langton will remain in No. 2; the door of communication
can be opened between them.</p>

<p><i>March 2nd, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;This morning I was reading in
bed by candlelight from 5.30 to 6 o'clock, and again
heard the pattering sound which has become familiar
to us in No. 8. Miss Moore was asleep, but happened
to awake while the sound was specially distinct, and
without speaking signified that she was giving it her
attention. Shortly after six we heard the sound of a
violent fall about the middle of the west wall, between
the fireplace and window. Our first thought was that
one of the maids upstairs must have fallen, till we remembered
that there was no room above us. We have
since inquired, and find that none of them moved till
nearly seven o'clock, nor was anything heard either by
them or by Mr. Garford, whose room (No. 1) joins our
west wall.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>Miss "N." passed a very disturbed night. She went
to bed about twelve o'clock; she is habitually an exceptionally
good sleeper, and, moreover, has slept in
many rooms alleged to be haunted without the slightest
inconvenience, and has never had an "experience" of any
sort. She lay awake in discomfort till 3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, and then
sought refuge with Miss Langton.</p>

<p>Miss "N." left. The following is the record of her
impressions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>March 4th.</i>&mdash;You ask me to write exactly what I felt in
No. 3 when I slept there on March 1st. Well, it is rather
difficult to describe! I never felt frightened out of my
wits at nothing before, if it <i>was</i> nothing. I certainly saw
no shadows or figures, and the only noise I heard was the
thud twice, which sounded as if it came from the storey
below. If I shut my eyes for a minute I felt as if I was
struggling with something invisible (not indigestion, as I
never have it!). I was so paralysed that I <i>dare</i> not call out
to Miss Langton, and lay awake from twelve to three without
moving! In the morning, of course, I felt I had been
a fool to be so silly, and I would go and sleep there again
to-night if I had the chance."</p>

<p>Mrs. B. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> came. She is an Associate S.P.R., is a
Highlander, has been all her life interested in psychical
matters, but has had no "experience."</p>

<p>Mr. "Endell," Miss Moore, and I sat up in No. 3 till
about 2.30 in the dark, except for the firelight, and in
silence, except when any one wished to draw the
attention of the rest to sounds or sensations. There
were no sounds for which, on reflection, we found it impossible
to account. Mr. "Endell" suffered, as on previous
occasions, from the sensation known as "cold-air," and<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>
very visibly shivered, though clearly not in the least
nervous. He is keenly interested in psychical inquiry,
but has never had any "experience" other than subjective
sympathy with the psychic impressions of others,
or a consciousness, such as he described on his arrival
here, of an atmosphere other than normal. (This last
has been of frequent occurrence, and seems to have been
always veridical.)</p>

<p>The sole experience of any kind on this occasion was
my own. Mr. "Endell," by way of reproducing the conditions
of former occupants of the room, threw himself
on the bed about twenty minutes to 2 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> Soon after
he was seized by audible and visible shivers. We did
not speak till he uttered some forcible ejaculation of
complaint, when, looking towards him, I saw a hand
holding a brown (probably wooden) crucifix, as by a
person standing at the foot of the bed. He immediately
said, "Now I'm better," or words to that effect.</p>

<p>We persisted in silence till perhaps 2.30, when we
agreed to separate, and while we were having some
refreshment over the fire, I told Miss Moore and Mr.
"Endell" what I had seen. (<i>Cf.</i> under date February 25,
p. 132.)</p>

<p><i>March 3rd, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> left.</p>

<p>This afternoon we had a call from Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> and her
daughter. The Colonel, Miss Moore, and I were in the
room.</p>

<p><i>March 4th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;Mr. "Endell" left.</p>

<p>Heavy snowstorm.</p>

<p><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><i>March 5th, Friday.</i>&mdash;Last night I was in bed and asleep
before Miss Moore came in from her dressing-room. She
did not light the candle for fear of waking me, but, while
sitting by the fire reading, she heard the pattering noise
just behind her, in the same place where we have heard
it and the fall before, though never till then at night.
It only lasted a few minutes, but there was apparently
nothing to account for it, though of course she took
every possible means to discover its cause.</p>

<p>Mrs. B. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> left to-day. Miss Moore happened to mention
at breakfast that the upper housemaid had told her
that the maids had twice again on the last two nights heard
the sound of monotonous reading, once as late as 2 <span class="sc">a.m.</span></p></div>

<br />

<p>The theoretical hour for Mattins is midnight,
which, however, is only observed in practice in
certain very rigid monasteries; in others it
begins at two. But it is easily conceivable that
a priest, if wakeful at that time, would select it
in preference to another.</p>

<div class="block"><p>Mrs. B. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> at once said that she also had heard
precisely that sound each night, and had spoken of it to
her maid, and, like the servants, had concluded that Miss
Moore was reading to me, although it was as late as
twelve o'clock. She had also heard a bang on a door
close to her own, but had supposed it was a late comer,
possibly one of the gentlemen from the smoking-room,
and had not been disturbed. She had been sleeping in
No. 1, her maid in No. 2, and none of the gentlemen are
on the same floor. Mr. Garford, who is now in the wing,<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>
remarked that he too had heard voices as of speaking or
reading several times when sleeping in No. 1, but had
assumed that they were normal. As a matter of fact,
Miss Moore goes straight to her dressing-room on going
upstairs, and I am always too tired to read or speak. No
two persons sleep in any other room.</p>

<p>We tested this by getting Colonel Taylor to shut himself
into No. 1 while I, in No. 8, read aloud at the top of my
voice, Miss Langton remaining in the room with me. The
Colonel could hear no sound less than direct banging on
the wall with a poker.</p>

<p>The cook has been talking to-day of the various noises
heard at night; she is not nervous, nor are the maids,
but all speak of voices and bangs for which they cannot
account; except the butler, who has heard nothing, but is
obviously impressed with his wife's experience last night.
Her story is that, not feeling well, she went up to bed
early, before the servants' supper, the rest of the household
being as usual in the drawing-room. While in bed,
before ten o'clock, she distinctly heard the sound of voices
talking, apparently below, but not far distant (her room
is over No. 7, at present empty). She "wondered if it
could be the servants in the servants' hall at supper"&mdash;an
obvious impossibility, as their room is <i>not</i> underneath, is
two storeys away, and has no connection with the upper
part of the house. She also heard bangs on the wall,
behind her bed and to the side; there was no furniture
there to crack, and it was mostly on the <i>outside</i> wall, so
she finally became uncomfortable, and buried her head in
the clothes to deaden the sound. She "doesn't believe in
ghosts," but thinks the house "very queer," and says that
far and wide in the country round it is spoken of as<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
"haunted," though no one seems to know of any story,
as to the cause, except that, very improbable, about the
murder of a priest by the wife of a former proprietor. It
appears that a maid engaged in the village refused to
sleep in the house, because when in service here once
before she had been frightened by bangs at the door of
her bedroom (in a room over No. 1); she had also heard
the sounds of a rustling silk dress on the back-stairs, and
had seen the bedroom door pushed open and a lady come
in.... A maid, who came after this one had left, told
the cook that she believed there was a story of a "priest
murdered somewhere at the Reformation"; she had once
been told it by Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> in explanation of the noises,
but had not heard whether the said murder was in the
house or the grounds, and thought Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> particularly
did not wish the spot known. This maid has only been
an occasional help in the house, but has lived for years in
the district, and knows the place well by reputation.</p>

<p>To-day as we passed through the churchyard, [a resident
in the neighbourhood] pointed out the desolate grave of
the Major, with the remark that one could hardly be
surprised at a man being said to "walk" who was expected
to rest in such a place as that. He said that there
had been a great deal of talk all over the neighbourhood
as to the excitement during the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s'</span> stay at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
and seemed to believe that practical joking might account
in part for what had occurred. He did not, however, deny
that stories had been told long before their coming to
the place.</p></div>

<br />

<p>This resident is the one as to whom the <i>Times</i>
correspondent dogmatically stated, that having<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>
lived in the place for twenty years he asserted
that there had never been a whisper of the
haunting of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> until the tenancy of the
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s.</span></p>

<div class="block"><p><i>March 6th, Saturday</i>.&mdash;Mr. Garford left.</p>

<p>The Colonel is to sleep to-night in No. 3, which has not
been occupied since Miss "N." left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> arrived. He sleeps, by his own choice, in
No. 2. He has had a conversation with the butler, whom
he had been instrumental in engaging for us, which
began by his asking how he liked his situation? He
expressed himself satisfied with everything, but added,
"But there's something very queer about the house,"
and then proceeded to tell his wife's experience.</p>

<p><i>March 7th, Sunday</i>.&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> has written an account
of his experiences last night.</p>

<p>Robinson has this morning told him of his first experience!
He was awakened by the noise of a heavy
body falling in the middle of the room; he awoke his
wife, struck a match, and looked at his watch&mdash;it was
3.30; no one else had been disturbed. Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>
account follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>March 7th, 1897.</i>&mdash;It was arranged that Colonel
Taylor should occupy No. 3, and that I should sleep in
No. 2. I went to bed about twelve, but did not go to
sleep at once.</p>

<p>"I awoke suddenly with the distinct impression that
there was some one in the room. I lay still, and tried
to realise what was in the room, but could not do so.
There was no idea of movement in my mind, but still<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>
I felt convinced that some one was there. The impression
seemed gradually to fade out of my mind after about seven
or ten minutes, and then I got up and looked at my watch&mdash;the
time was 4.40 <span class="sc">a.m.</span></p>

<p>"I then went back to bed, but did not go to sleep. I
heard the clock in the hall strike five.</p>

<p>"Shortly after I thought I heard some one moving about
in No. 1, which I knew to be unoccupied. I listened, and
it seemed to me that some one was moving round three
sides of the room and then coming back. The movement
went on for about three or four minutes and then stopped,
but after a pause of some minutes it began again. I tried
to make out footsteps, but could not do so. The movement
was that of a heavy body going round the room, and the
floor seemed to shake slightly, after the way of old flooring
when a heavy man moves about. After going on for
some time the movement stopped, and again, after a pause,
began again. The movement, whatever it was, occurred
four times, with three pauses in between. The durations
of the movement and pauses were irregular. After the
noise ceased I got up and lit the candle. The time was
5.25, and I read for twenty-five minutes, when I felt
sleepy and blew out the candle. I did not, however, go
to sleep, and I heard six strike. The day was dawning.
The rooks I first heard about 5.35, when I was reading.</p>

<p>"About ten minutes after the clock struck six I heard
a noise like a light-footed person running downstairs,
which seemed to adjoin No. 3, where the Colonel was sleeping,
and almost immediately after I heard a loud rapping
at the door of No. 1. After a short pause this occurred
again, and I jumped out of bed. As I opened the door
of my room leading into the passage the rapping sounds<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>
occurred again, but less loudly. There was no one in the
passage, and I went back to bed, not having quite shut my
door. No sooner had I done so than there was a knock
at my door, which I thought must be the Colonel coming
to speak to me about the rapping at No. 1. I called out
'Come in,' but there was no answer, and I accordingly
again went to the door, only to find no one.</p>

<p>"I heard the servants begin to move about at 6.30 above
me, and as seven struck I heard them going through
the house.</p>

<p>"The Colonel did not hear anything.</p>

<p>"There are no stairs coming down to the bedroom
storey where I thought I heard footsteps.</p>

<p>"The rapping was not in any way an alarming noise.</p>

<p>"On Saturday night 'Ouija' had said that I was not to
be disturbed that night, so I was 'not expecting.' It
also stated that Nos. 3 and 8 were the rooms that 'the
Major' occupied."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p><i>March 8th, Monday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> left early. He has promised
to write of any experience last night, as he was gone
before we were up. Colonel Taylor is still in No. 3;
he has heard nothing, but this is perhaps the less evidential,
that, although a frequent visitor to haunted houses, he
has never had any experience.</p>

<p>We are still in No. 8, in which we have had a sufficient
number of experiences to make us anxious to distribute
responsibility by handing it over to another sensitive at
the earliest possibility. Miss Langton has hitherto slept
in No. 4, in which she was put on her first arrival, except
for the three nights she was in No. 2, with companionship
in the adjacent rooms. There seems to be no object in<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
the Colonel remaining in No. 3, as he is unlikely to see
or hear anything, and as soon as that side of the house is
quite emptied she proposes to go into No. 1, as we are
anxious to discover whether her experience will corroborate
that of Miss Moore, myself, Mrs. B. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Mr. Garford,
and the maids, as to the sound of voices.</p>

<p><i>March 9th, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> writes this morning
in regard to Sunday night: "<i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;... Last night
I was not so much disturbed, but I awoke at 3.10, and
did not sleep after that. I had exactly the same sensation
as on the previous night, that whenever I was going
to sleep something woke me. At 5.20 I heard three
noises very close together, but they were very distant, and
sounded from the direction of your room" (No. 8).</p>

<p><i>March 10th, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I awoke about 5.30, and lay
awake reading. I had drawn the blinds up, but kept
the candle in as long as it was required. At intervals
between twenty minutes to six o'clock and ten minutes
past I heard the sounds characteristic of No. 8., viz., footsteps
of a man, and pattering of a dog. Miss Moore
awoke, and heard the later sounds. About 6.10 we both
heard the thud, which seems to occur generally beyond
the wardrobe nearer the door.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Miss Moore and I called on Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p><i>March 11th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;Very wet day, no phenomena.</p>

<p><i>March 12th, Friday.</i>&mdash;Another wet day. I had had a
headache all day, and was unable to join the others in
a walk when the rain cleared off, but I went out, alone,
about 6.30 to the copse. Standing in my usual place,<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
I saw the nun coming over the hill towards the burn;
she stood nearly opposite to me, looking down to the
water for a few minutes, and then moved away towards
the avenue. I followed as quickly as possible, but when
I got to the drive she was still a few yards ahead of me,
and I failed to catch her up, though I pursued her down
to the lodge, about two hundred yards; she then, passing
through the gates, turned to the left, and I lost her in
the obscurity of the road, which is there darkened by
heavy trees. When I returned to the house I was still
in so much pain that I took a sedative draught and went
to bed, and to sleep at once.</p></div>

<br />

<p>With regard to the above it may be remarked
that the way she came led from <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> Cottage,
where by the kindness of Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> some nuns
had formerly spent their annual holiday, and
the road on which she disappeared was a way
which would have led back to it.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>March 13th, Saturday.</i>&mdash;At ten o'clock last night Miss
Moore woke me to take some food. I was still under
the influence of the opiate, and did not really rouse, even
when she came to bed half-an-hour later. We did not
speak till I was aroused by a loud banging noise, when,
in answer to my startled exclamation, Miss Moore suggested
that it was probably the servants shutting up
downstairs, as we were early, and they had very likely
not yet gone to bed. I was much annoyed, as I knew
they had been cautioned to keep quiet, and even the
maid had not been allowed to enter my room. This<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>
morning, when Miss Moore went to see the housekeeper,
the butler came in and asked if we had heard any noises
last night, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, he thought,
after every one had gone up to bed; adding, "It was two
bangs like a fist on a door, and I said, 'If that isn't Miss
Moore or Miss Langton, I'll believe in the noises they all
talk about,'&mdash;it's just like what the gentlemen told me."</p>

<p>His wife had also heard the bangs, but had waited for him
to speak to her of them, and the maids on the other side
of the house had been roused to come to their door and
listen.</p>

<p>The footman, who sleeps in the basement, and the
Colonel, who was in the smoking-room in the wing till
11.30, heard nothing; but Miss Langton, in No. 4, to
whom Miss Moore mentioned the servants' story, had
heard noises "between 10.30 and 10.45," but had not
been disturbed, thinking, as we had done, that they were
probably made by the servants.</p>

<p>On inquiry we found that the cook had gone to bed
directly after the servants' supper, the two under maids
were up by ten o'clock (Miss Moore heard their voices
when she came to my room at ten o'clock), and the upper
housemaid had gone up a few minutes after the hall clock
struck, following Miss Moore up the stairs. The butler
had come up directly after, only waiting to put out the
hall lamp, and all were in bed before 10.30. We ourselves
noticed the striking of the hall clock <i>after</i> we heard the
noise&mdash;it had gone wrong, and only struck nine instead of
eleven o'clock&mdash;so there seems little doubt that we all heard
the same sound, and all describe it as coming from below.</p>

<p>In discussing the occurrence with the butler and his
wife, Miss Moore learned that they had lately heard a<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>
story [from a local resident] which was new to us. A
maid of Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who, though married to the butler,
still lived in the house, and performed her duties as usual,
was one night coming up the back-stairs with a tray for
Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> when, on reaching the top, by the door of
No. 3, she met the figure of a nun, which so frightened
her that she dropped the tray and broke all the plates
on it. Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> explained it away by saying it was
"only <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;"</span> (they could not remember her name) "come
to pray with her." It was Sunday night, but they knew
there was no one there who could in the least account
for the appearance. The only explanation offered by
the narrator of the story was that "there had been a Miss
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> a nun, who had died."</p>

<p><i>March 14th, Sunday.</i>&mdash;I called on Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and had a
long talk with her.</p>

<p><i>March 15th, Monday.</i>&mdash;Miss Moore and I, both awake at
the time, heard a loud, vibrating noise about a quarter to
six. Miss Langton in No. 4 heard it also. The Colonel,
who sleeps downstairs, heard it as from the hall, and said
he also felt the vibration. Except for about three nights
he has always slept in the wing, where, during our tenancy,
there have been no phenomena.</p>

<p><i>March 16th, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Miss Moore, Miss Langton, the
Colonel, and I, left <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Miss Moore, Miss Langton,
and I returning on March 20th.</p>

<p><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>After leaving <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> Colonel Taylor wrote as follows to
Lord Bute:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>March 19th, 1897.</i>&mdash;"I arrived in London yesterday,
after having spent five weeks at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> very pleasantly.
I feel sure that there <i>is</i> a ghostly influence pervading the
house, but I am a little disappointed at the way in which
it manifests itself, for, up to the time I left, the nature of
the manifestations was such that, though it is satisfactory
to me, it would not be so, I think, to those who do not
look at such things from so favourable a position as I do.</p>

<p>"I hope a change may yet come, and things take place
which one might think would justify people in evacuating
and forfeiting their money as the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> did; certainly
nothing of this sort happened while I was there.</p>

<p>"It is very interesting to note Miss Freer's experiences,
but in regard to those of others who have something to
relate, it is perhaps difficult to determine how much
these statements should be discounted for error of observation
and self-suggestion. I heard many noises in the
night during my stay at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> but they were of much
the same sort I have been accustomed to hear at a
similar time in other houses. I think that some of our
witnesses may have given them undue prominence, under
the influence of their own expectancy. The clairvoyant
visions of 'Ishbel' in the grounds are not of great
evidential value for the scientific world in general, and I
think that any amount of 'voices' could be read into
the noises of the running stream, near where she is seen,
by those who 'wished to hear.' Still, there are some
objective noises which cannot be easily accounted for in
an ordinary way, and the three almost independent visions
of the brown cross are important.</p>

<p><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>"I hope things will improve; in any case, you will have
added considerably to psychical research when all has
been recorded...."</p></div>

<br />

<p>It is difficult perhaps to see why Colonel
Taylor should regard the independent visions of
the crucifix as of more value than the equally
independent and far more numerous hallucinations,
audible and visual, of "Ishbel." We have
the statements of the failure of several persons
who "wished to hear" voices in the sounds of
the burn, which was, moreover, frozen and silent
when the voices were heard by the first two
non-expectant and quite independent witnesses.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>March 19th.</i>&mdash;A passage in Miss Langton's private
journal under this date is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>St. Andrews, March 19th.</i>&mdash;I looked into a water-bottle
to-night to see if I could see anything of what was happening
at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> I distinctly saw room No. 3, and gradually a
figure came into view between the two doors (<i>i.e.</i> near the
foot of the bed), the figure of a tall woman, dressed in a
long clinging robe of grey, and who seemed to be holding
something in her hand, against the wall at the foot of
the bed. This became more distinct, and I saw that it was
a cross of dark brown wood, some 12 inches long (I should
say). The figure did not appear to move. I seemed to be
standing at the door of No. 3, which opens on to the
landing" (<i>cf.</i> pp. 17, 132, 142).</p></div>

<br />

<p><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>For the information of those not accustomed
to the phenomena of crystal-gazing, it may be
as well to remark that it is quite possible that
the image had been subconsciously seen by
Miss Langton when sleeping in No. 3, as deferred
impressions are often externalised for the first
time in the crystal. She may equally have received
the impression by thought-transference
from others. Certainly she had not been informed
of earlier experiences.</p>

<p><i>March 21st, Sunday.</i>&mdash;Last night, about 11.15, after Miss
Moore and I were in bed in No. 1, we heard a loud sound
from the left-hand side of the fireplace (south-west corner).
It might be imitated by the "giving" of a large tin box
(<i>cf.</i> pp. 173, 179). There was nothing but a footstool and<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
a draped dressing-table there. We called out to Miss
Langton, whom we could hear still moving about. She
said she had heard the noise, but had made none herself.</p>

<p>Her account is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night (Sunday, March 21st) we retired to bed early,
as Miss Moore was leaving by an early train next morning,
and I was going to get up in order to see her off. It was
certainly not later than 10.45, when I went to my room,
having gone to No. 1 to say good-night to Miss Freer
and Miss Moore, who were sleeping that night in that
room. Miss 'Duff' was in No. 3, and I was occupying
No. 2. I am not at all nervous, and certainly I was not
expecting to see anything, as No. 2 is always supposed
to be a 'quiet' room. I was some time getting to bed,
but I put out my candle at twelve o'clock, and, after
noticing that the moon was shining brightly, I got into
bed. Contrary to my usual custom I did not fall asleep
for some time, and I felt that the room was, in some
inexplicable way, not as usual. At last I fell asleep, but
not comfortably. I kept waking, and for some time after
each awakening I could not get to sleep again. I put
this down, however, to the fact that I wanted to waken
early the next morning, and was restless in consequence.
At last I really fell asleep, but at 4.30 I suddenly
awakened with the feeling that I was not alone in the
room. I looked round; the room was quite dark; the
moon was not shining, but between the bed and the
wardrobe there was a figure standing. At first it was
very indistinct and misty, but gradually it formed itself
into the figure of a woman&mdash;a slight, tall woman, with a
pale face. She was dressed in long robes, but the upper
part was the only part I could see clearly. Round her<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
face and head was a white band, like that worn by a nun,
and over her head was what might have been a black
hood or small shawl, but in the darkness it was very
difficult to distinguish. I could not see what her features
were like, but she looked as if she were in trouble, and
entreating some one to help her. She stood for some
few moments at the foot of my bed looking towards me,
and then she made a movement towards the door, but
before she reached it she had vanished. I was not at all
frightened, as there was nothing at all alarming in her
appearance. I cannot write a better description of her, as
the vision was so short. The figure was the same as that
I had seen at the burn, only very much clearer."</p>

<p>Miss "Duff" writes under this date March 21st:&mdash;"On
my arrival yesterday I was shown to my room (No. 3),
which I had selected, with Miss Freer's permission, as one
said to have an evil reputation. Perhaps it was natural
that a feeling 'as if I were not alone' should come over me,
and needless to say there was no <i>apparent</i> cause for this!</p>

<p>"As a rule I am a very sound sleeper, nothing ever
disturbs me; but last night I was suddenly wide awake,
as if roused by something unusual. I sat up quickly in
bed, but suddenly remembering where I was, I waited
expectantly. Nothing occurred, although I did not get
to sleep again for about two hours."</p>

<p><i>March 22nd, Monday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> was awakened
between four and five by heavy footsteps overhead. We
made many experiments to account for it, and of course
made inquiries among the servants, but could find no
cause. We are the more interested that hitherto nothing
has been heard by our party in his room, No. 4, though
there is a tradition of earlier disturbances there.</p></div>

<br />

<p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> has furnished the following
account of his experience:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As usual I went to bed about 12 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> I
had no desire to be disturbed, and so my
room was still No. 4, which I had originally
selected as being reputed innocuous, and
which, save in one slight instance, I had
hitherto found to deserve its reputation. My
repeated visits had eliminated any expectancy
which may at first have, perhaps, existed.</p>

<p>"My bed was alongside the south wall of my
room, and parallel to the corridor or passage, my
head towards No. 5, and my feet towards No. 3.</p>

<p>"As often happened at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> I awoke from
a sound slumber, not by degrees, but in a
moment. There was no transition&mdash;no half-awakening,
but full and complete consciousness
all at once. I struck a light, looked at my
watch, found it was 4.30, and went to sleep
again immediately. I then wakened slowly and
gradually, hearing more and more clearly a noise
which appeared to me to be the cause of my
awakening. The noise was the kind of sound
which is produced by a person walking rapidly
with one foot longer than the other&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
was a succession of beats in rapid sequence,
each alternate beat being louder than the one
immediately before it.</p>

<p>"It appeared to me (1) to be produced outside
my room; (2) to be on a higher level;
and (3) to be moving in the direction of my
bed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, going as from No. 5 past No. 4, in
which I was, towards No. 3. I at once jumped
out of bed, opened my door and looked out. I
saw nothing, and the noise stopped. I then
struck a light, and found that it was only 4.45.
I lay awake till I heard the servants obviously
moving about, and then went to sleep again.
At breakfast I asked, 'Has anybody ever heard
this kind of noise?' reproducing it as well as
I could by a series of thumps on the table.
'Oh yes,' was the answer, 'that is what we
call the 'limping' or 'scuttering' noise. Of
course I had heard the phrases used, but thought
they referred to two separate noises. I had
also formed quite distinct ideas as to the kind
of noises these epithets were intended to describe&mdash;both
entirely different from the kind
of noise I had heard&mdash;and I showed what I
meant. 'Oh no,' said Miss Freer, 'what you<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>
heard is what we have been calling indiscriminately
the <i>limping</i> or <i>scuttering</i> noise, and we
have not heard the kinds of noise these words
suggested to you.' I emphasise this as showing
clearly that I cannot have been expecting to
hear the particular noise in question.</p>

<p>"The next thing was to account for the noise,
if possible, and we spent some time experimenting.
First of all the servants were interrogated
as to whether any of them had been moving
about at 4.45. Answer, 'No.' Next we asked
who got up first. This was a maid who slept
in <span class="sc">x</span>, and went into <span class="sc">y</span> to call the kitchenmaid,
who slept there. To do so she had, of course,
to go through the narrow room which was over
part of my bedroom.</p>

<p>"This, she said, was a good bit later than 4.45.
But we thought it well to make her go from
<span class="sc">x</span> to <span class="sc">y</span> while I lay down on my bed and
listened. We made her walk backwards and
forwards, both with her slippers on and also in
her stocking soles. I and some of the others
who came into my room heard her quite distinctly.
But (1) the noise of her steps was in
a different place&mdash;near my window, and exactly<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
in the line of her progress; (2) it was an entirely
different kind of noise. She walked now fast,
and now slowly, but both footsteps seemed
always of the same weight; and (3), and this,
to my mind, was most important, we heard her
quite distinctly going from <span class="sc">x</span> to <span class="sc">y</span>, and back
again from <span class="sc">y</span> to <span class="sc">x</span> and could tell in which
direction she was moving. Now, the noise
which I had heard only went in the one direction,
<i>i.e.</i>, parallel to the maid's outward progress.
I did not hear anything going in the other
direction. I was entirely wakened by the
noise which I had heard, and, as I have said,
I continued to listen intently for some considerable
time, and yet I heard nothing.</p>

<p>"In short, alike from its apparent <i>locus</i>, from
its quality, and from the direction of its movements,
I am convinced that the noise which I
heard was not caused by any of the servants
moving about upstairs.</p>

<p>"Anybody who knows the house will understand
that where the noise seemed to me to be
was in the neighbourhood of the dome. For all
I know, the dome, as somebody suggested, may
be a regular sounding-board; but even so, that<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
does not help much towards an explanation.
Wherever the noise may have been produced,
the question still remains, 'What produced it?'
and that we have entirely failed to answer."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The gist of this account was communicated by
Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> to the Hon. <span class="ws">E&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">F&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who
replied as follows on April 19, 1897: "Do you
appreciate the fact that your ghost, with the
footsteps of alternate lowness and softness, is
absolutely correct, and corresponds with Miss
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> ghost, as I heard it from Mrs. <span class="ws">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>
lately in town. Miss <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> slept, I <i>think</i>,
in No. 4 [this is wrong; <i>cf.</i> p. 124], and was
wakened by the sound of walking round her
bed with a peculiar limp. Much alarmed, she
went and called her brother, who came and
slept on the sofa (is there a sofa in No. 4?), and
shortly afterwards they both heard the same
noise again."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;,</span> as already mentioned, did not
know that this noise had been heard by any
one.</p>

<div class="block"><p>Miss "Duff" thus describes her next night: "Having
heard nothing unusual all day, I went to bed quite disappointed.
However, I was to be again awakened, and<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>
this time by a loud <i>crash</i> at my door, which resounded
for some time. I lit a candle, but nothing had fallen in
my room to account for the sound.</p>

<p>"I began to think I might be mistaken as to the direction
of the noise, and that it might have been caused by
a large piece of coal falling in the fender. I went to
look, but there was no coal at all, only the dying embers
in the fire. I soon fell asleep again, only to be again
awakened by a similar crash (although not so loud), and
this time between the washstand and the window. I
kept awake till morning, and heard nothing more." [We
had carefully concealed from Miss "Duff" the nature
of the usual phenomena of this room.]</p>

<p>Miss "Duff" writes under this date:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night I sat late by my fire <i>expecting</i>, but as nothing
seemed to be going to happen I went to bed, and soon
to sleep. However, I was to have my most startling
experience! I was awakened as if by some one violently
shaking my bed (I must mention there was a great wind
blowing outside), and at the same time I felt something
press heavily upon me. <i>I struck out!</i> rather frightened,
but remembering again where I was, refrained from striking
a light, in order to see the next development of this weird
experience. To my disappointment nothing happened,
although sleep was successfully banished till daylight."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>[On March 28th Miss "Duff" wrote to me: "Mr.
<span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> suggested that I should describe to you more
accurately the shaking of my bed, as it was not at all
such a vibration as might be caused by a high wind or
any ordinary movement occurring in other parts of the
House.</p>

<p>"The bed seemed to heave in the centre, as if there
were some force under it, which raised it in the centre
and rocked it violently for a moment and then let it sink
again. I should also have added, that on other nights
quite as windy this phenomenon did not occur; in fact,<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
no movement I have ever felt has given me quite the
same sensation. The highest point on the 'Switchback'
is the nearest to it in my experience. I was wide awake
at the time, so it was no nightmare."]</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Miss "Duff" thus continues her account of Tuesday,
March 23rd:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This morning, as I sat in the drawing-room, I heard the
low, monotonous voice of some one reading aloud. Knowing
that Miss Freer and Miss Langton were writing in
the next room, I concluded that Miss Freer must be
dictating while Miss Langton wrote for her, although I
must say I did not recognise Miss Freer's voice. This
went on for about an hour. Soon after Miss Langton
came into the drawing-room, and I said, 'Well, you
<i>have</i> been busy; I suppose Miss Freer has been dictating
to you?' She looked surprised and said, 'No, indeed
she hasn't; we have both been writing, and if Miss Freer
spoke at all, it was only a few words now and again.'"
This low monotonous sound of a human voice I afterwards
heard once or twice in Room 3.</p>

<p><i>March 24th, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Last night I heard a crash as
of something falling from the dome into the hall, about
twenty minutes to twelve.</p>

<p>At breakfast Colonel <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> said he had heard a loud
thump on his door at an early hour&mdash;before six, when
wide awake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> also had had an experience. He heard
sounds outside his room, and went to investigate. On
returning he found the kitten in his room, but, sceptic
as he is, he acknowledged freely that the kitten, a wee
thing, could not have produced the sounds he heard.</p>

<p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
<i>Copy of letter from</i> Mr. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> <i>to</i> Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>"<i>March 24th, 1897.</i>&mdash; ... In case it may interest Miss
Freer to know what I thought of the noises I heard in
No. 1 prior to the kitten incident, the following states
my recollections shortly: The first noise was about half-past
four, and resembled two small explosions, such as
a fire sometimes makes. They followed one another
closely, and came from the direction of the fireplace or
the south-west corner of the room. I got up and looked
at the fire, and it was all but out; but I would not like
to swear that the noises did not come from it.</p>

<p>"As to the other noise, it occurred about a quarter to
six, and was quite loud. It sounded as if one of the large,
deer heads on the staircase wall had fallen down and
rolled a step or two. I cannot understand how some of
the others did not hear the noise, but I heard and saw
nothing when I went out of my room to see what it was.</p>

<p>"I should add, that in this case, as well as in the former
one, I was awake when the noise occurred. If I had
heard these noises in any other house I would not have
thought of noticing them, but it might be curious to see
if they are the same that have been heard in that room
already."</p>

<p>After breakfast I heard of a great excitement among
the servants, and taking Miss Langton with me, to serve
as witness and to take notes, I interviewed separately
the three concerned, as well as the cook, to whom they
had told the story also. It is worth while to mention
that I have several times heard the kitchenmaid complained
of as lacking in respect for her betters&mdash;in
scoffing at their reports of phenomena. Only yesterday<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>
Mrs. Robinson told me she had not mentioned several
things (bell-ringing, a knock at her door, &amp;c.) because
it upset her authority in the kitchen to exhibit interest
in such things.</p>

<p>All the stories were consistent, and no cross-questioning
upset the evidence. They were distinctly in
earnest.</p>

<p>The three maids and a temporary servant, <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
belonging to the district, went up to their rooms about
10.30. The two housemaids sleep together [in <span class="sc">z</span>], Lizzie,
the kitchenmaid, separately, in a room adjoining [in <span class="sc">y</span>].
Directly after getting into bed all heard knockings, and
they called out between the rooms to each other. Lizzie
stayed awake, and looking up towards the ceiling had
what sounds like a hypna-gogic hallucination, of a cloud
which changed rapidly in colour, shape, and size, and
alarmed her greatly. Then she felt her clothes pulled
off, but thought this might be accidental, and tucked
them in. Then she was sure they were pulled off again,
and screamed to the other maids. Neither dared go to
her, her screams were so terrifying; but they finally
opened the door of communication between the rooms,
and Carter went to fetch the temporary assistant from
the other end of the corridor, "because she was such a
good-living girl" (particular about fasting in Lent, I
gather). The three then returned for the kitchenmaid,
and all spent the night in the housemaid's room.</p>

<p>The upper housemaid went to Miss Langton's room
this morning, I hear, much upset and crying, and there
can be no doubt of the conviction of all the maids.</p>

<p>For the future they wish to occupy one room.</p>

<p>The cook, sleeping on the ground floor below No. 3,<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>
heard footsteps and knockings, and awoke her husband,
but he heard nothing. She diagnosed it as being "about
the door of Miss 'Duff's' room (No. 3 above). She
thought it was outside of her door, but was not sure.
It was just after midnight.</p>

<p>Miss "Duff" writes on the same day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night I had just got into bed, when I heard footsteps,
so, always on the alert for phenomena, I listened
and was relieved (? disappointed would be better!) to
hear Mr. <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> cough, so I settled down to sleep. A
quarter of an hour or twenty minutes later (about twelve
o'clock) I again heard steps, but this time they came from
the back-stair and shuffled past my room, and then I heard
a loud fall against what seemed to me the door of room
No. 1, which is practically next door to mine.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>"I went to listen, but not a sound was to be heard, and
I saw no one. It could not have been the gentleman
who was occupying that room [Mr. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;</span>], as I heard him
(with others) come up a quarter of an hour later and go
into his room. Although the fall seemed <i>against</i> the door
of No. 1, I must add that the depth and quality of the
noise was as if a large body had fallen far away, of which
we only, as it were, heard the echo, but that <i>quite distinctly
on</i> the door of No. 1."</p>

<p>[Miss Langton testifies to being disturbed by the
same sounds in No. 2, the dressing-room between Miss
"Duff's" room and Mr. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>.]</p>

<p>Miss "Duff" continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>March 25th.</i>&mdash;Last night I felt my bed shake, as if some
one had taken it in both hands, but as there was a high
wind, I did not take much notice of this. I have had my<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
bed shaken violently in that room once before, however,
when there was no wind at all."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Captain <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> left. The only
phenomenon to be noted under this date is the following
record by Miss Langton:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I heard a loud thump at the door of communication
between Nos. 1 and 2 when dressing for dinner, but on
going into No. 1 found it quite empty. A curious point
about these noises is that the knocks on the door between
Nos. 1 and 2 have been audible in this room, No. 2 (in
my experience) only when No. 1 is empty, and in No. 1
only when No. 2 is empty."</p>

<p><i>March 26th, Friday.</i></p>

<p>Miss "Duff" writes on the same day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As I was talking to Miss Langton at the door of her
room (No. 2) on my way to dress for dinner, a double
bang on the door came from the inside of room No. 1,
which was the one Captain <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> had occupied, and
where he had heard nothing. At the same moment
Miss Langton called out that there had been a bang on
the door between her room and No. 1. For a moment
I hesitated to go in, but a housemaid came down the
corridor at that moment to see what the noise was
she had heard, and we investigated together, but to no
purpose."</p>

<p>Miss Langton writes further under this date:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I heard three distinct bangs at the lower part of the
door of my room leading into the corridor. I described
it to myself as a person coming along the corridor towards
No. 2, walking in an unsteady way, and as if he could not
see where he was going, and then walking straight against<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>
the door of my room and banging his foot against it.
Miss 'Duff' this morning acted at our request as I
have just described, and the noise she made was an
exact reproduction of what I heard last night. The
bang occurred at three intervals&mdash;at 11.35, 11.45, and
11.50."</p>

<p><i>March 27th, Saturday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Miss "Duff" left.
Miss Langton and I are now alone.</p>

<p>Miss "Duff" was undisturbed last night.</p>

<p>There was very little wind last night, as I happen to
know in the following connection. Carter twice over,
about 11.30 and again after midnight, heard the sounds
of reading, which she imitated to me this morning&mdash;like
the monotoning of a psalm. She called out to two other
maids to listen, and all three heard it. She felt sure it
was not the wind or the pipes. Both the gardener and
the gamekeeper say it was a very quiet night.</p>

<p><i>March 28th, Sunday.</i>&mdash;As it had been suggested that
practical joking or malicious mischief were in question, we
were a good deal on the <i>qui vive</i> to-night, being alone. I
watched from behind the curtain at an open window from
10.30 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> till after midnight, and again from 4.30 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> to
6 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> The night was windy and there was a good deal
of noise, but very different in kind from any of our usual
phenomena. We found that there were people moving
about till after midnight, but we did not attach much
importance to this, as the gardeners may have been to
the stoves (the night was frosty), and there is a right-of-way
through the grounds.</p>

<p>No phenomena.</p>

<p><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>The servants, we find, are alive to the fact that some
one prowls about at night. The footman, who sleeps
downstairs, says they have tried to frighten him, and
things have been thrown at the kitchen windows. I
found it out by the fact that I was seized by the butler
and footman when I went out "prowling" on Sunday
night, fancying I had heard footsteps. They were on the
same errand, and caught me in the dark!</p>

<p><i>March 29th, Monday.</i>&mdash;To-day Miss Langton and I have
been very busy writing in the library, both silent and
occupied. Again and again have we heard footsteps overhead
in No. 8, at intervals between ten <span class="sc">a.m.</span> and one, and
again in the evening between six and seven. No rooms
are in use on that side of the house&mdash;6, 7, and 8 are all
empty. The rooms below are locked up and shuttered.
At 11.30 we both heard some one moving about outside
on the gravel, but it was too dark a night to see any
one.</p>

<p>[<i>Friday, April 2nd</i>&mdash;An unpleasant light has (possibly)
been thrown on these movements. We find to-day that
some one has killed a sheep in the garden, in a retired
spot, taking away the skin and the meat.]</p>

<p><i>March 30th, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;No phenomena, except the sound
of steps overhead above the library. For this reason,
Miss Langton is going to sleep in No. 8, where the steps
occur.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> came.</p>

<p>[We were particularly glad to welcome Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> for
other reasons than the pleasure of her society. She is of
Spanish origin, and a Roman Catholic, and according to
previous evidence, so were other persons upon whom
specially interesting phenomena had been bestowed.]</p>

<p><i>March 31st, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Mr. and Mrs <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> were put
into No. 1. Both complain of a very sleepless night.</p>

<p>Miss Langton in No. 8 heard sounds after daylight&mdash;footsteps
shuffling round the bed, and a knock near the
wardrobe. No one is overhead nor in No. 7, the next
room.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> spent two hours alone in the drawing-room.
She asked me just before lunch what guns those
were she had heard. I suggested "The keeper?" and
she said, "No, it is like the gun you hear at Edinburgh
at one o'clock <i>a long way off</i>," which is a good description
of the familiar detonating sound (<i>cf.</i> under date,
February 8).</p>

<p>Her own account of the day is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="sc">"B&mdash;&mdash; House.</span></p>

<p>"I arrived here last evening, Tuesday, 30th of March,
about six o'clock. It was a nice bright evening, but cold.
I was received by Miss Freer, who gave me some tea,
and then I was taken to my bedroom by Miss Langton,
of whom I asked if my room was haunted. She said
it had 'a reputation', but somehow or another it did not
seem to impress me much. That night Miss <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
her brother dined here; they were very pleasant, and
talked away hard, and we played card games, such as
'Old Maid' and 'Muggins.' We went to bed feeling
quite happy, saying we had never been in such an<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>
unghostly house before. The bed was quite comfortable,
and we lay talking quite happily, but could not sleep,
and were not in the least bit restless. About two o'clock
we dozed off, and a few minutes to four <span class="sc">a.m.</span> we were
both suddenly awoke by a terrific noise, which sounded
to me like the lid of the coal-scuttle having caught in
a woman's gown. We then lay awake until about 6.30,
and in that interval we heard a few noises, what I cannot
exactly describe, as they were very ordinary sounds one
might hear in any not very solidly built house. We came
down to breakfast feeling we had passed a sleepless night,
but otherwise quite happy. After breakfast I went into
the smoking-room in the new wing, where my husband
was writing letters. I sat there a good time, and he was
in and out of the room. All the time I heard tramping
up above as if the housemaid was doing the room. Not
knowing the geography of the house I took it for No. 8.
and thought what very noisy servants these were. I
then went into the drawing-room to write my own letters,
and Miss Freer came and spoke to me there. While she
was with me there, I heard a distant cannon, exactly like
the one o'clock gun in Edinburgh, and the whole morning
a ceaseless chatter, which I put down to Miss Freer and
Miss Langton in the room next door (<i>cf.</i> under date,
March 23rd).</p>

<p><i>April 1st, Thursday.</i>&mdash;This is Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> account of
last night. "Last evening we were late for dinner, as Mr.
<span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> and I had been out to see the nun by the burn,
but had seen nothing. The whole evening I had a sort
of half consciously disagreeable feeling, and when I went
to my room it was some time before I could make up my
mind to get into bed. The servants very much annoyed<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>
me; they were making such a needless amount of noise in
running about the room overhead. [The room overhead
was empty. Since their adventure of March 23rd, the
servants had slept on the other side of the house.] At
last I got into bed, and I may say I hardly slept a wink
the whole night. I simply lay in terror, of what I cannot
say, but I had the feeling of some very disagreeable
sensation in the air, but we did not hear a sound all
night from the time we got into bed until we got up
next morning at 8.30.</p>

<p>"I spent the whole of the morning in the drawing-room
writing letters and reading, and from time to time I went
up to No. 1 to get books and different things, and each
time was a little surprised to find the room empty, as
there had been a ceaseless noise of housemaids, and very
noisy ones too. I also heard what I had described before
as the cannon. After luncheon Miss Freer and Miss
Langton and I went out walking, and just as we were
coming in to tea we all three heard the cannon, and then
I said that is the noise I heard every morning, and sometimes
in the evening, in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>This afternoon we were having tea in the drawing-room
at 4.30, Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Miss Langton, and myself.
We heard some one walking overhead in No. 1, a sound
we have heard often before, when we knew the room to be
empty above. Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> remarked that it was just the
sound she had heard, again and again, when sitting alone
in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was so exactly the heavy, heelless steps we had
heard before, that Miss <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> ran upstairs softly to see
if any one was there, but found no one about. Next we
heard a loud bang&mdash;not of a door&mdash;in the hall, and she<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
went out again to ascertain the cause, and met the butler
on the same errand. We could find nothing to account
for it. It was like the noise before described, of something
dropped heavily into the hall from the gallery
above.</p>

<p>There had been so much trouble of ascertaining whether
the noises were caused by doors banging, that since the
warmer weather set in, ever since our return on March
20th, in fact, we have had every passage-door opening
into the hall and into the gallery upstairs fixed open with
wedges.</p>

<p>We had scarcely settled to our tea again before we
again heard the footsteps overhead, and again Miss
Langton went up and found the room empty. She walked
across the room, and we heard her do so, but the sound
was quite different. She did it noisily on purpose, but
though she is very big and tall, she didn't sound heavy
enough.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> remarks, on hearing this read over, that
the sound was different in character as well as in volume&mdash;that
the footsteps she (and we) heard were "between
a run and a walk." My phrase was, and has always been,
"as of the quick, heavy steps of a person whose foot-gear
didn't match." We called it, when we first heard it in
No. 8, a "shuffling step."</p>

<p>After she came down the servants' tea-bell rang, and
we at once said, "Now we shall know where they all
are." The hall is under the wing, at the other end of
the house, and we knew that the room underneath us was
empty, and the shutters up, and that all who were in the
house were either in the drawing-room or the servants'
hall.</p>

<p><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>In a few minutes we again heard the pacing footsteps,
up and down, up and down; we heard them at
intervals during half-an-hour. We also heard voices as
of a man and woman talking. I went to the foot of the
stairs, just below the door of No. 1, and heard them plain.
Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> is not quick of hearing, but she heard them
distinctly several times. At 5.20 we heard the maids go
up the stone staircase, coming away from their tea, and
though we listened till after six, the other sounds did not
occur again.</p>

<p><i>April 2nd, Friday.</i></p>

<p>[Mr. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> left early, Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> remaining till a
later train.]</p>

<p>At 11.15 Miss Langton and I were in the library at
two different tables writing. The room was silent.
Suddenly we heard a heavy blow struck on a third table,
ten feet at least away from either of us. I instantly
fetched Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and in her hearing Miss Langton
imitated the sound on the same table, by hitting with her
fist as heavily as possible. There is a drawer in the table,
empty, which added to the vibration, and also pendent
brass handles. I tried, but could not make noise enough.
We kept watch in the room till lunch, Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>
keeping guard when we were obliged to leave, but
nothing happened till, when we were sitting at luncheon
(there is only a single door and a curtain between the two
rooms), we heard it again as above described.</p>

<p>One of the informants, who described the scene which
occurred the day the late Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> left this house for
the last time, said "a very heavy blow like a man's fist
came on the table between them." This is the same room.</p>

<p>The same sound occurred again while we were at lunch<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
in the dining-room just now. The first time Miss Langton
rushed to the library and found a housemaid there at the
stove, so we agreed it should not count. It occurred again
in about five minutes, and again she went into the room
(which is next the dining-room) and found it empty and
no one in the hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> whom I asked to locate the sound, pointed
to just that part of the wall by the table upon which the
knock had struck.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
Signed (as correct) by Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Miss Langton.</p>

<br />

<p>(I have since asked the housemaid if she heard anything,
and she says no, she was making too much noise
herself. We all heard it distinctly, above the clatter of
the fire-irons.)</p>

<p>On April 9th Mr. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> sent me the following account
of his impressions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... You ask me to describe the noises I heard while
staying with you at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> I should say, in the first
place, that I am a good, but light, sleeper; I seldom lie
awake, am generally asleep five minutes after going to
bed, but wake easily, and awake at once to full consciousness.
I am not the least nervous, and have often slept
in so-called 'haunted' rooms [Mr. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> has had very
exceptional opportunities in this direction]; and while I
certainly cannot say that I altogether disbelieve in what
are commonly called 'ghosts,' I do believe that in nine
cases out of ten, noises, and even appearances, may, if
investigated, be traced to perfectly normal causes.</p>

<p>"We spent three nights at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;:</span> March 30th and
31st, and April 1st. The first two nights room No. 1<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>
was our bedroom, and the third night room No. 8. Room
No. 2 was my dressing-room.</p>

<p>"When talking to you and Miss Langton at the top of
the stairs, just before going to bed, we all of us heard
noises&mdash;rappings&mdash;coming apparently from No. 2. The
noises were very undoubted, but as we were talking at
the time I cannot define them more accurately.</p>

<p>"When first going to bed, both nights in No. 1, we heard
footsteps and voices apparently in conversation above us.
The sounds seemed to come from a room which was over
the bed, but did not extend as far as the fireplace in
No. 1, and also from the room which would be above the
room next to ours behind the bed."</p></div>

<br />

<p>The rooms overhead were empty. <i>Cf.</i> under
date April 1st.</p>

<div class="block"><p>"These noises I attributed at the time, and still attribute,
to the maids going to bed. I am bound to say,
however, that they were heard both by Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
her maid, who was in No. 1 with her, during the daytime,
at an hour when it was said no servants were upstairs.
These voices and footsteps did not go on for long
into the night. For (I should say) some hours during the
night of the 30th, I frequently heard a sound which
seemed to come from near the fireplace, and which I
can best describe as a gentle tap on a drum&mdash;like some
one tuning the kettle-drum in an orchestra. I do not
think Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> heard this noise, for though she slept
very badly, she was dozing a good deal during the first
half of the night. At 3.55 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> I was in a state of semi-consciousness,
when both I and Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> were fully<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
roused by a noise so loud that I wonder it did not wake
people sleeping in other parts of the house. It seemed
to come either from the door between No. 1 and 2, or
from between that door and the fireplace. To me it
sounded like a kind of treble rap on a hollow panel, but
far louder than any one could rap with their knuckles.
My wife described it as the sound of some one whose
gown had caught the lid of a heavy coal-scuttle and let
it fall. This noise was not repeated, and by a treble rap
I mean the sound was like an arpeggio chord. I feel
certain it was not against the false window outside,
indeed it had the sound of being in the room. The
kettle-drum sounds might easily have been a trick of the
wind, though the night was still, but the only natural
explanation of this noise that I can give is practical joking,
as the noise <i>might</i> have come from my dressing-room. The
coal-scuttle was standing between the fireplace and door-post,
just where the sound seemed to come from. The
second night I moved the scuttle right away to between
the head of the bed and the window, and the noise was
not repeated. The second night the talking and footsteps
were both heard when first we went up; and once,
shortly after all was still, early in the night. Nevertheless
we again both of us slept very badly indeed&mdash;I may say
that except from about 6 to 8 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> I slept very little
either night. I should say that all through both nights
I frequently heard the owls hooting&mdash;both the tawny owl
and another, which I think was the little owl; the former
on one occasion was very close to the window, and any
one with a vivid imagination or unacquainted with the
cry of the owl (and, strange as it may seem, a country-bred
girl, staying at <span class="ws">L&mdash;&mdash;</span> the other day, did <i>not</i> know<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>
the owls' cry when she heard it), might well take it for
shrieks."</p></div>

<br />

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;No one ever heard shrieks during
Colonel Taylor's tenancy at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<div class="block"><p>"The third night, as I have said, we were in No. 8, and
both of us slept like tops, and heard or saw nothing.</p>

<p>"One morning, in the smoking-room in the east wing,
I heard voices which <i>seemed</i> to come from above, but
which I am convinced were from the kitchen beneath.</p>

<p>"As you know, 'Ishbel' was not kind enough to show
herself to me....</p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I wrote the above without reading over my wife's
account. I have only to add that I had none of the uncomfortable
sensations she talks of. Bodily and mentally
I was comfortable all night. Nor was I in the least restless&mdash;only
wakeful. But for the noises, <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> certainly
strikes one as a very unghostly house."</p>

<p><i>April 3rd, Saturday.</i>&mdash;Miss Langton and I heard footsteps
walking up and down overhead at dinner-time last
night, in No. 7, a room which is not in use. We looked
at each other, but did not at first say anything, on account
of the presence of the servants. After it had gone on for
at least ten minutes, I asked the butler if he had heard
them. He at once said, "Yes, and might he go and see
if any one were about?" We heard him go upstairs and
open the door of the room, and walk across it, but his
step was quite different from the sound we had heard.
He came back saying, "The housemaid had been in to
draw the blind down since we had been at dinner." I
have questioned her since, and she says she simply went
in and out again&mdash;was not there half a minute.</p>

<p><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>About four o'clock this afternoon, Miss Langton ran in
from the garden where we were gathering fir-cones, to
fetch a basket out of the library, and heard so much noise
going on in the drawing-room that she went in to investigate.
It was empty and silent. The noise was a violent
hammering on the door between the two rooms on the
drawing-room side.</p>

<p>The two rooms below the library and drawing-room
were empty, and shuttered (the smoking-room and
billiard-room), No. 1 was disused (over the drawing-room),
and Miss Langton found no one in No. 8 (over the
library). She came back and told me at once.</p>

<p>I have now had the following rooms locked up and the
keys taken away by the butler:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ground floor: All the wing and drawing-room.</p>

<p>Above: 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. (I am sleeping in No. 5,
Miss Langton in No. 8.)</p>

<p>Basement: Smoking and billiard rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> arrived in the afternoon. We were all out
till dinner-time. While at dinner, we all three, as well
as the butler, heard steps walking overhead in No. 7, as
we did last night.</p>

<p><i>April 4th, Sunday.</i>&mdash;I was wakened early this morning
by the sound of a crash. As it was mixed with my
dreams I did not think it worth while to get up and investigate,
but looked at my watch. It was twenty
minutes to six. Five minutes later I heard another crash
under the dome&mdash;of the kind so often described&mdash;and
looked out, but the house was perfectly still. I heard
the servants come down about seven o'clock.</p>

<p>Miss Langton, sleeping in No. 8, describes the same
sounds at the same moment.</p>

again the sound of voices from the same room in the

They were talking, but not moving about. [I learnt on
inquiry that they were all in bed by 10.30.&mdash;A.G.F.] I
went to sleep immediately after I got to bed, but woke
up later with a violent start, as if by a loud noise, though
I heard nothing. I waited a few minutes and then
looked at my watch. It was 12.30. I heard voices talking
pretty loud. I was awake over three-quarters of an

<p>This afternoon Mrs. <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;,</span> a lady well acquainted with
the neighbourhood, came to tea. She asked me about the
hauntings, and said they were matter of common talk in
the district. She also told me that in the late Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;'s</span>
time it had been alleged that the disturbances were intentional
annoyances, though she agreed it was rather a
sustained effort.</p>

<p>Early this morning (I am still sleeping in No. 5)
I heard the familiar crash under the dome. It was
about 2.30. Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> said at breakfast that he had
heard it too.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 7th.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> writes under this date:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To bed about eleven. To sleep at once. Awakened
at 2.30 by a terrific crash, and the sound of voices. A
little later I heard light raps at the foot of my door, as if<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
a dog had wagged his tail against it. Looked out, saw
nothing; very disturbed night."</p>

<p><i>April 8th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> writes, "Woke last
night at 12.30. Heard nothing, but slept very badly. I
may mention that I am, as a rule, a very sound sleeper,
and as I had taken a lot of exercise every day&mdash;fishing,
shooting, cycling, and walking, from breakfast-time to
dark&mdash;there was no reason why I should not sleep."</p></div>

<br />

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> had been out the whole of this
day with the keepers&mdash;heather burning&mdash;and
was obviously "dead tired" when he went to
bed. It is curious that even when not disturbed,
he should have slept so badly, but
sleepless and nameless discomfort has assailed
most persons in No. 1, though the room is large
and airy.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>April 8th, Thursday.</i>&mdash;We had planned to leave yesterday,
but it was borne in upon me that to-day being the
anniversary of the Major's death, it would be a pity&mdash;on
the hypothesis of there being anything supernormal in
these phenomena&mdash;that the house should not be under
observation to-night.</p>

<p>In the morning the Land-steward called, having heard
from Mrs. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> that we had heard footsteps about the
house at night, and that I had several times observed a
disreputable-looking man about the place, whom I knew
not to be one of the farm-servants.</p>

<p>The admissions hitherto made by him, and by <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>
<span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;,</span> as to some of the phenomena, carry the evidence
back for over twenty years.</p>

<p>I don't know whether we have been specially on the
<i>qui vive</i> to-day, but we seem to have heard bangs and
crashes and footsteps overhead all day, though all the
rooms, except Nos. 1, 5, and 8 are locked up&mdash;Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> occupies
No. 1, Miss Langton No. 8, I No. 5.</p>

<p>Acting upon the hints given us by <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and <span class="ws">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, I
thought the downstairs smoking-room ought to be specially
under observation to-day. I was suffering from acute
headache, and was obliged to lie down in my own room
from lunch-time to dinner, and this smoking-room, which
is known as "the Major's room," was the only sitting-room
in use. A few minutes before dinner, I went down
and busied myself in putting my camera to rights. It was
a delicate piece of work, and when I saw a black dog,
which I supposed for the moment to be "Spooks" (my
Pomeranian), run across the room towards my left, I
stopped, fearing that she would shake the little table on
which the camera stood. I immediately saw another dog,
really Spooks this time, run towards it from my right,
with her ears pricked. Miss Langton also observed this,
and said, "What is Spooks after?" or something of that
sort. A piece of furniture prevented my seeing their
meeting, and Spooks came back directly, wagging her
tail. The other dog was larger than Spooks, though it
also had long black hair, and might have been a small
spaniel.</p>

<p>[It was not till after we had left <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> that we
learned that the Major's favourite dog was a black
spaniel.]</p>

<p>After dinner we returned to this room. I had intended<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
to try Ouija and the crystal, but was in too much pain to
make this possible, and Miss Langton felt she could not
do it alone; it was as much as I could do to sit up at all,
but, by a strong effort of will, I was able to remain downstairs
till after midnight. [I was still occasionally suffering
from the results of my accident.] We sat in front of the fire,
playing a round game. About nine we all three heard footsteps
coming from the south-west corner and going towards
the door; I held up my hand for silence, but I could see,
from the direction of their eyes, that they heard the sounds
as I did&mdash;even the dog looked up and watched. The steps
were those of a rather heavy person in heelless shoes,
who walked to the door, and came back again, passed
close behind Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> chair, crossed the hearth-rug
just in front of me, and stopped at or about the north-east
corner, but&mdash;it seemed&mdash;remained in the room, behind
Miss Langton's chair. We heard them again about 10.30;
we also heard sounds several times during the evening of
the talking of a man and woman. Three times over Miss
Langton and Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> went out to listen, but the
house was perfectly quiet, and though we were on the
same floor with the servants, there had been, the whole
time, three closed doors between us and their quarters in
the wing, which also was in the direction opposite that
from which the sounds came (the present billiard-room).
About 10.45, Miss Langton and I went up to the dining-room
in search of refreshment; everything upstairs seemed
perfectly still, and the servants had long before gone
to bed. Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> followed us up, and as we went
back to the smoking-room, the voices seemed to be in
high argument just inside. We could distinguish no
words, though the <i>timbre</i> of the voices is perfectly clear in<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
my memory. About 12.20 we went to bed. I had intended
to sit up in No. 8, but found I was not equal to
it, and Miss Langton would not accept my offer of sleeping
there with her. She was therefore there alone, I in
No. 5, and Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> in No. 1. I had not been many
minutes in my room when I heard the familiar loud crash
as of something falling into the hall, under the dome, and
rushed out immediately&mdash;the house was perfectly still.
We had left a small lamp burning in the corridor. Mr.
<span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> said, next morning, that he had also came out
at the sound, but must have been later than I, as he was
just in time to see my door shut. About twenty minutes
after, I heard the shuffling footsteps come up the stairs,
and pause near my door; I opened it, and saw nothing,
but was so definitely conscious of the presence of a personality,
that I addressed it in terms which need not be set
down here, but of which I may say that they were intended
to be of the utmost seriousness, while helpful and
encouraging. I may add, that I knew from experience of
the acoustic qualities of the house, that I should not be
audible to those in Nos. 1 or 8. Absolutely, while I was
speaking, the voices we had heard downstairs became
audible again, this time it seemed to me outside the door
of No. 8; they were certainly the same voices, but seemed
to be consciously lowered. (Miss Langton's account will
show that she heard voices and footsteps outside her
door at about this time.) I was asleep before the clock
struck two, but was awakened again about 3.30, and was
kept awake for more than an hour by various sounds in
the house. Roughly speaking, these were of two kinds:
one, those of distant clangs and crashes which we have
heard many times in varying intensity, loudest of all on<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>
our first night and on this. The other (more human in
association), knocks at the door, thuds on the lower panels
within, say, two feet of the ground; footsteps, not as
before, but rapid and as of many feet, and again the same
voices. The night was perfectly still, and I could clearly
differentiate the cries of the owl (of two kinds, I think),
the kestrel hawk, and even of the rabbits on the lawn. I
went to the windows and looked out, but the night was
quite dark, and the dawn was grey and misty.</p>

<p>About 5.45 I fell asleep, and did not wake till my tea
came up at 7.30, when I asked the maid if she had been
disturbed, and she replied that the servants had been
extra busy the day before, had gone to bed early, and
had slept soundly.</p>

<p>Miss Langton and Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> attest the above as a
correct account of our experience, so far as they were
concerned.</p>

<p>The following is from Miss Langton's private diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Freer, Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and I all agreed that, as
it was the anniversary of the old Major's death, we
would sit to-night in his own sitting-room, which we
always call 'the downstairs smoking-room.' Just before
dinner, Miss Freer, who was sitting between the writing-table
and fireplace, suddenly called out, 'What is Spooks
running after?' and then she said that there were <i>two</i>
black dogs in the room, and that the other dog was
larger than Spooks she said, 'like a spaniel.'</p>

<p>"After dinner we three sat round the fire and played
games; suddenly one of us called out, 'Listen to those
footsteps,' and then we <i>distinctly</i> heard a heavy man
walking round the room, coming apparently from the
direction of the safe, in the wall adjoining the billiard<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
room, and then walking towards the door, passing between
us and the fireplace in front of which we were sitting. It
was a very curious sensation, for the steps came so very
close, and yet we saw nothing. Footsteps died away, and
we resumed our game. Three times over we distinctly
heard outside the door the voices of a man and woman,
apparently in anger, for their voices were loud and rough.
Each time we jumped up at once and opened the door
quietly&mdash;there was nothing to be seen; the passage was in
total darkness, all the servants having gone to bed (the
last time was nearly eleven o'clock). We certified this fact
by making an expedition into the kitchen regions. We
then returned to the smoking-room, and not long after
the footsteps again began in exactly the same direction.
This time they lasted a longer time.</p>

<p>"I slept in No. 8, and was so tired I slept pretty well,
but before going to sleep, just before one o'clock, I heard
the sound of a heavy man in slippers come down the
corridor and stop near my door, and then the sound as of
a long argument in subdued voices, a man and a woman."</p></div>

<br />

<p>On April 9th Miss Freer and Miss Langton
left <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> in order to pass Easter elsewhere,
and Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> left with them.</p>

<p>During Miss Freer's absence the house was
occupied for some days by the eminent classical
scholar Mr. F.W.H. Myers, late Fellow
of Trinity College, Cambridge, one of her
Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, and Hon. Sec.
to the S.P.R.</p>

<p><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>It is well known that the S.P.R. is very
greatly indebted to Mr. Myers for his most
valuable services for many years as Hon. Sec.,
and for his many important contributions to its
literature. He has, however, of late years somewhat
alienated the sympathies of many of its
members, by the extent to which he has introduced
into its <i>Proceedings</i> the reports of
spiritualist phenomena, and the lucubrations
of mediums. The original rules of the society
would appear to exclude the employment of
hired mediums, and it is difficult to distinguish
Mrs. Piper, and certain other subjects of experiment,
from this class. The differences, however,
between Mr. Myers and some of the members
do not stop at this point, for his preference
for the experiences of female mediums, whether
hired or gratuitous, would appear to amount
to an indifference to spontaneous phenomena,
an indifference that is distinctly and rapidly
progressive.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers, however, appeared to take considerable
interest in the phenomena of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
and on March 13, 1897, after reading the
journal for the first five weeks, the only part<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
of the evidence which has been submitted to
him, or indeed to any member of the Council
of the S.P.R., he wrote to Miss Freer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is plain that the <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> case is of <i>great</i>
interest. I hope we may have a discussion of
it at S.P.R. general meeting, May 28th, 8.30,
and perhaps July 2nd, 4 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, also. Till then, I
would suggest, we will not put forth our experiences
to the public, unless you have any other
view....</p>

<p>"I should particularly like to get Mr. ['Q.']
to go again in Easter week [<i>i.e.</i> during the
Myers' tenancy]. I saw him last night, and heard
his account, and next to yourself he seems the
most sensitive of the group. I am very glad
that you secured him.... I will send back
the two note-books after showing them to the
Sidgwicks. I am so very glad that you and
others have been so well repaid for your
trouble.... You seem to have worked natural
causes well."</p>

<p>On April 12th Mr. Myers arrived at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
and remained until the 22nd. He was preceded
a day or two earlier by Dr. Oliver Lodge,
Professor of Physics at Victoria College,<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>
Liverpool, Mrs. Lodge, and a Mr. Campbell of Trinity
College, Cambridge. The party also included a
"medium," the only person to whom this term
could be applied, in the ordinary sense, who
visited <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> during Col. Taylor's tenancy.
This person was a Miss <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> but in order to
avoid confusion with other persons, she is here
called Miss "K." Miss "K." is not a professional
medium, in the same sense in which
a gentleman rider is not a jockey. She is
the proprietress of a small nursing establishment
in London, and at the time of her visit
to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was described as in weak health and
partially paralysed. She was accompanied by
an attendant who was a Roman Catholic, a circumstance
which is interesting in view of the
strongly sectarian character of the ensuing
revelations.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers recorded regularly, and transmitted
to Lord Bute, the account of the phenomena
which occurred during his visit, and which were
testified to by four members of his party. He
declines, however, to allow any use to be made
of his notes of what occurred during this
episode.</p>

<p><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>The regret with which his wish is deferred to
is the less, because the chief value of the notes
in question seems to be that of a warning
against the methods employed; a fact of which
Mr. Myers seems later to have himself become
aware, as in regard to his journal letters to
Lord Bute he wrote on March 15, 1898, <i>a
year later</i>, "I am afraid that I must ask
that my <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> letters be in no way used.
I greatly doubt whether there was anything
supernormal."</p>

<p>However, while actually staying at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
Mr. Myers wrote to Miss Freer on April
15th, in much the same terms as on March
11th:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is your idea (I am asking Lord Bute
also) <i>re</i> speaking about <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> at S.P.R? If
this is <i>not</i> desirable on May 28th, should you
have second-sight material ready then? If it is
desirable, could we meet sometime, ... and discuss
what is to be said? As many witnesses
as possible. Noises have gone on. I am
writing bulletins to Lord Bute, which I dare
say he will send on to you.... I am
moving into No. 5 to be nearer to the noise.<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>
I have heard nothing. Lodge hears mainly
knocks."</p>

<p>On April 21st he wrote again to Miss
Freer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you come to S.P.R. meeting, we
could talk in a quiet corner after it. I dine
with S.P.R. council at seven o'clock, so
there would scarcely be time [<i>i.e.</i> to call
on you] between, but I would call <span class="ws">at&mdash;&mdash;</span>
at 9.30 Saturday morning, if that were
more convenient to you than going to the
meeting."</p>

<p>The interview took place, and July 2nd was
finally arranged as the date upon which the
evidence was to be presented at a general
meeting of the S.P.R.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the article of the
anonymous <i>Times</i> correspondent appeared in
that journal on June 8th&mdash;an article which was
practically an attack on certain methods of
the S.P.R., after which Mr. Myers published
the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></p>

<p class="cen">ON THE TRAIL OF A GHOST.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>To the Editor of "The Times."</i></p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;A letter entitled 'On the Trail of a Ghost,' which
you publish to-day, appears to suggest throughout that some
statement has been made on behalf of the Society for Psychical
Research with regard to the house which your correspondent
visited. This, however, is not the case; and as a misleading
impression may be created, I must ask you to allow me space to
state that I visited <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> representing that society, before your
correspondent's visit, and decided that there was no such evidence
as could justify us in giving the results of the inquiry a place
in our <i>Proceedings</i>. I had already communicated this judgment to
Lord Bute, to the council of the society, and to Professor
Sidgwick, the editor of our <i>Proceedings</i>, and it had been agreed
to act upon it.&mdash;I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="sc">Frederick W.H. Myers</span>,<br />
<i>Hon. Sec. of the Society for Psychical Research.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="sc">Leckhampton House, Cambridge</span>, <i>June 8</i>."</p>

<br />

<p><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>One may gather from a comparison of this
letter with the foregoing records that the standard
of evidence is a somewhat variable quantity
in the Society for Psychical Research. In
attempting to explain the matter, Mr. Myers
wrote to Lord Bute, June 11, 1897:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to haunted houses recorded at length
in <i>Proceedings</i>, there have been several minor
ones, and one especially, 'Records of a Haunted
House,' where I was instrumental in getting the
account written. The great point there was
the amount of coincidence of visions seen independently....
In the <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> case there is
<i>some</i> coincidence of vision, but so far as I know,
not nearly so much as in the Records of a
Haunted House, which did appear in <i>Proceedings</i>.
We want to keep our level approximately
the same throughout."</p>

<p>Another point of view in relation to the same
matter, is that taken by Miss Freer in an article
in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, August 1897:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the S.P.R. recognised that haunted
houses were among the alleged facts of general
interest, was proved by their early appointment
of a Committee of Inquiry, on the management<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
of which it is too late to reflect. At the end
of a few months only, they practically dismissed
a subject which, if considered at all, required
years of patient research. They had come across
the surprising number of twenty-eight cases
which they considered worth inquiry; but these
were presented to the public on the evidence
of only forty witnesses&mdash;that is to say, an
average of less than one and a half to each!
The appearance of figures is recorded in twenty-four
of these stories, whilst four record noises
only. Ten years later the <i>Proceedings</i> take up
the subject again, and give us at some length
an elaborate story on the evidence of two or
three ladies, two servants, a charwoman, and a
little boy. ['Records of a Haunted House.']
No proper journal was kept, and the Society for
Psychical Research came upon the scene when
all was practically over."</p>

<p>In relation to the period of the visit of the
Myers party to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> House, Lord Bute received
several journal letters from Professor
Lodge, as well as from Mr. Myers, which, as
he has made no request to the contrary, might
be quoted here <i>in extenso</i>, were it not that they<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
relate in considerable part to the proceedings
of the medium, as to which the present editors
agree with Mr. Myers, that "they greatly doubt
if there was anything supernormal."</p>

<p>Professor Lodge was from the first much
interested in the <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> inquiry, and wrote to
Lord Bute on April 14th, two days after
arrival: "I have not found anything here as
yet at all suitable for physical experiments.
I have heard a noise or two, and intelligent
raps. Nothing whatever can be normally seen
so far."</p>

<p>And on April 17th: "The noises and disturbances
have been much quieter of late, in
fact have almost ceased <i>pro tem</i>.... We have
not heard the loud bang as yet. Knocks on
the wall, a sawing noise, and a droning and
a wailing are all we have heard. The droning
and the wailing, some whistling, and apparent
attempts at a whisper, all up in the attic,
may have been due either to the wind or
birds. They were not distinct enough to be
evidential, though they were just audible to
all of us. The sawing noise was more distinct.
I think I will go to the attic about 3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>
to-night to see if anything more can be heard.
Most of the noises occur then, or else at 6 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>
Mr. Campbell has heard a dragging along the
floor in his bedroom, No. 3. I have heard, like
many others, the knocking on the wall, but
for the last two nights things have been
quiet.</p>

<p>"<i>April 20th.</i>&mdash;There has been nothing here
for me to do as a physicist, and I return home tomorrow,
but nevertheless the phenomena, taken
as a whole, have been most interesting....
I know that you are hearing from Mr. Myers
the details of our sittings.... There is certainly
an interregnum of noises, the last three nights
having been undisturbed. [After describing
recent s&eacute;ances with Miss <span class="ws">'K&mdash;&mdash;.'</span>] I write
just as if what we have been told were true.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
The cessation of the noises may of course be<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>
merely a temporary lull as before, and they
may break out again...."</p>

<p>On April 22nd, he wrote to Miss Freer
"The sounds are not very strong, and latterly
there has been one of your interregna in the
noises, but still we heard some of them; only
knocks, however, except once a low droning,
a sawing noise, and a whistling whisper.
Some of the raps seemed intelligent, but there
was nothing to investigate on the physical
side...."</p>

<p>And in another note, undated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There has been nothing capable of being
photographed. The sounds are objective though
not impressive.... I have seen nothing to suggest
electricity or magnetism, or any of the
ordinary physical agents in connection with the
disturbances; but the noises are so momentary
and infrequent, that they give no real scope for
continued examination."</p>

<p>Professor Lodge left on April 21st, and Mr.
Myers on April 22nd; but Miss <span class="ws">"K&mdash;&mdash;,"</span> with
Mr. Campbell, remained alone till the morning of
Monday 26th, and on the afternoon of the same
day Lord and Lady Bute arrived, and stayed<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>
till Wednesday 28th. Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who came
with them, was obliged by previous engagements
to leave next morning.</p>

<p>They slept in the wing, and nothing occurred
during their visit so far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>Lord Bute records, however, that he twice
read aloud the whole of the Office for the dead
in its five sections (vespers, nocturns, and lauds)
in different places, but neither he nor any one
with him saw or heard anything, unless it were
a sound of women talking and laughing while
he was reading the Office about 10.30 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> in
No. 8, and this he supposed was simply the
maids going to bed, though in fact the room
overhead was unoccupied. He had, however, a
most disagreeable impression, not in the places
where he expected it, which were the glen,
No. 3, and No. 8, but in No. 1. The sensation
was that of persons being present, and on the
second occasion that of violent hatred and
hostility. He recorded "Went to No. 1 a third
time, and again experienced the sensation of
persons being present, but on this last occasion
as though they were only morosely unfriendly."</p>

<p>It is remarkable that this sensation of unseen<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>
presences is one which many other persons experienced
in this room, and in this room only;
but it is also remarkable that this was the first
indication of the hostile or irreligious tone
which was thenceforth apparent. Until the
sojourn of the party of members of the S.P.R.
the tone had been plaintive and religious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who is a Presbyterian, made
a remark which struck Lord Bute as interesting,
to the effect that the whole of the Office
for the dead, with the frequent occurrence of
the words <i>Requiam eternam</i>, &amp;c., might be as
irritating to Intelligences which desired to
communicate, as would be the effect of saying
merely "keep still," or "be quiet," to persons
who wished to set forth their wrongs. But this
curious hypothesis would be insufficient to account
for a sensation of absolute enmity.</p>

<p>A private letter, written by Lord Bute on
April 29th to a distinguished ecclesiastic, repeats
these statements, and adds one or two
additional touches which it is desirable to
quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We returned yesterday after spending forty-eight
hours at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> where we heard and saw<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>
nothing, but as my proceedings were mainly
ecclesiastical, your Grace may like to know
what happened.</p>

<p>"On the way I was shown the inclosure in
the churchyard wherein lie, in unmarked graves,
the late Major <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> his 'housekeeper,' and
his old Indian servant. I would have gone and
prayed there, but the place seemed to me too
public.... <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> is a remarkably beautiful
place, and the day was splendid; were it not
for the grandeur of the scenery, I should have
called the landscape laughing, or at least smiling.
The house is remarkably bright and cheerful,
and indeed luxurious. There is a really
nice set of family pictures from about the
time of Charles II.... The place is a perfect
aviary, and the sight of the innumerable birds,
evidently encouraged by long kindness, building
their nests was very pleasant, and has some
psychological interest, since animals sometimes
see these things when we do not, and there
was evidently nothing to scare the birds,
rabbits, or squirrels.... As her ladyship
and I did not wish to be troubled at night,
we took rooms in the wing, which the late<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>
Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> is said to have built in order to
save his children from the haunting, and which
has been but little troubled; and we slept there
quite comfortably. Soon after 6 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> I went to
the place near the burn where apparitions have
so often appeared, and which was, I think, first
indicated by Ouija. I read aloud the vespers
for the dead, but no phenomenon appeared, nor
had I any sensation. About 7.30 I went to a
room which I will call A [No. 1] ... and read
aloud the first Nocturn of the dirge; there was
nothing to be seen or heard, but I felt some
physical inconvenience in beginning, like an
impediment in speech, and I had a very strong
sensation that there were persons listening....<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
Soon after 10 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> I went and read aloud the
two next Nocturns in room B [8]. As I finished
the second, Mr. <span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> and I heard two<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>
women speaking merrily outside the door, and
I doubt not they were the maids going to bed.
During the night, although we slept well, my
servant [who slept in No. 4, next to Mr.
<span class="ws">MacP&mdash;&mdash;</span> in No. 5], like other people in
haunted rooms, could not sleep after five, and
he tells me one of the maids saw the bust of
a woman with short hair, as though sitting at
the foot of her bed.</p>

<p>"In the morning I said Lauds in room C
[Library]. No phenomena or sensation. Soon
after 5 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> said <i>Placebo</i> again in room B [8].
Nothing. Then visited the haunted burn again
for some time. Nothing. About 7.30 read the
first two Nocturns again in room D [No. 3].
Nothing. Soon after ten read the third Nocturn
in A [1]. Made slips of pronunciation, and felt
the presence of others very strongly, and that
it was hostile or evil, as though they were
kept at arm's-length; a disagreeable sensation
continued until I threw some holy water on my
bed before getting into it, when it suddenly
disappeared. Next morning I said Lauds in A
[1]. I had no difficulty in utterance; the sense
of other presences was not strong, and I had no<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>
feeling of hostility [on their part], but rather of
their having to put up with a slight nuisance
which would soon be over. These subjective
feelings are in no way evidential, nor would I
mention them were they not confined to one
place out of five, and occurred whenever I went
there, at three most varying hours.... My
servant, the second night, could not sleep
between 4.30 and 6."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Miss Freer returned alone to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> on April
28th. The Journal is now resumed.</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>April 28th.</i>&mdash;I returned to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> arriving at 7 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>
Slept in No. 8. Quiet night.</p>

<p>This morning I inquired of the servants as to what
occurred in my absence. They have very definite views as
to the nature and causes of the phenomena during the
visit of Mr. Myers's party ... including much table-tilting
at meals, and so on. When questioned as to any
experiences of their own, all answered to the same effect,
that they shouldn't have taken notice of anything that
happened at that time, but that something had occurred
after the last two members of the party had left on the
day of his Lordship's arrival, "and that," said the cook,
"was quite another matter."</p>

<p>The experience was Carter's, the upper housemaid, and
she told it in a manner that it would be difficult to distrust.
She was not anxious to talk about it, and seemed<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>
annoyed that it had been mentioned at all. I wrote down
her story verbatim.</p>

<p>"It was about four o'clock, or may be a little later, but
it was just getting light; there is no blind to the skylight
in my room, and I woke up suddenly and I thought some
one had come into the room, and I called out, 'Is that
you, Mrs. Robinson?' and when she didn't answer I
called out 'Hannah,' but no one spoke, and then I
looked up, and at the foot of my bed there was a woman.
She was rather old, and dressed in something dark, and
she had a little shawl on, and her hair short. It was
hanging, but it didn't reach nearly to her shoulders. I
was awful frightened, and put my head down again. I
couldn't look any more."</p>

<p>I asked about the height of the woman, wondering if it
were like the figure seen in the drawing-room, and Carter
said, "I didn't notice, only the top part of her." I said,
"Do you mean she had no legs?" and she said, "I didn't
take notice of any." She was genuinely concerned and
alarmed.</p></div>

<br />

<p>This is probably the incident thus described
by <i>The Times</i> correspondent. "One of the
maidservants described a sort of dull knocking
which, according to her, goes on between two
and six in the morning, in the lath and plaster
partition by the side of her bed, which shuts off
the angular space just inside the eaves of the
house. She likened it to the noise of gardeners
nailing up ivy outside. She seemed honest, but<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>
as she had seen the ghost of half a woman
sitting on her fellow-servant's bed, one takes her
evidence with a grain or two of salt. Any
noises she has really heard may be due to the
cooling of the hot-water pipes which pass along
behind the partition just mentioned to the
cistern." The hot-water pipe theory has been
already discussed.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, it had better be again
mentioned that, owing to the fact that several
of the persons interested in <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> were
Roman Catholics, and the Rev. <span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>
having been one of the principal witnesses,
as well as having himself appeared phantasmally
in the house, it was considered desirable
to obtain the assistance of some clergy
of that communion. Miss Freer accordingly
secured the services of three members of a
famous society; one of those was the Rev.
<span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> himself, one a well-known Oxford
man who takes much interest in such questions,
and the third a man of great experience at a
place where miracles are said to be frequent.
However, their Superior refused to allow them
to come, and she then applied to a well-known<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>
monastery, but was again refused help. Lastly,
she turned to the secular clergy, and obtained
the assistance of two priests and a bishop.
The priests are here designated <span class="ws">MacD&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
<span class="ws">MacL&mdash;&mdash;.</span> All three were previously well
known to her, and she had especial reason to
consider them not only worthy of her esteem
and confidence, but, moreover, as taking an

<p>The priests arrived late in the evening. I put them
in No. 3 and 4, though I like to give No. 1 to new-comers.
However, I had promised that to Madame Boisseaux,
whom we are expecting from Paris, with the dressing-room
for her maid.</p>

<p><i>April 30th.</i>&mdash;The priests both look very weary. They
were not frightened, but the sounds have kept them awake
all night.</p>

<p>Young <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> called to-day; he is going to help me
to get up a dance for the servants. His mother is away
at <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i>&mdash;I shall have to move the priests. They persist
that they are not frightened, but they are both looking
shockingly ill and worn, and the Rev. <span class="ws">MacD&mdash;&mdash;</span> is<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>
not in a state of health to take liberties with. The Rev.
<span class="ws">MacL&mdash;&mdash;</span> seems in the same mental state as was Mr.
<span class="ws">P&mdash;&mdash;.</span> He sees nothing, but is supernormally sensitive,
and without any hint from me, declared that he felt the
drawing-room, wing, and No. 7 to be "innocent."</p>

<p>Poor little "Spooks" is the chief sufferer. She sleeps
on my bed now, but even so, wakes in the night growling
and shivering, and she refuses her food, and is in a dreadfully
nervous state. Perhaps I ought not to keep her in
No. 8, where we have so often heard the patterings of
dogs' feet, and where Miss Moore was once pushed as by
a dog, in broad daylight.</p>

<p><i>May 2nd.</i>&mdash;Nothing occurred. We perhaps all slept the
sounder last night, having been kept up till two o'clock
waiting for Madame Boisseaux, who never turned up.
She and the <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;s</span> and Mrs. "F." arrived to-day.</p>

<p><i>May 3rd.</i>&mdash;The general tone of things is disquieting,
and new in our experience. Hitherto, in our first occupation,
the phenomena affected one as melancholy, depressing,
and perplexing, but now all, quite independently, say
the same thing, that the influence is evil and horrible&mdash;even
poor little Spooks, who was never terrified before, as
she has been since our return here. The worn faces at
breakfast were really a dismal sight.</p>

<p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>In spite of her long journey, Madame Boisseaux could
not sleep. She was so tired, she dropped to sleep at
once on going to bed, but was awoke by the sound of
a droning voice as if from No. 3, and, at intervals, more
distant voices in high argument. She said she dared
not go to sleep; she felt as if some evil-disposed persons
were in the room, and it would not be safe to lose consciousness.
But she saw nothing. She looks so ill that
her maid, a very faithful old servant, has been to beg
me, "<i>pour l'amour de Dieu</i>," to give Madame another
room. So to-night I will put her in <span class="ws">No. 5.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. "F." who was in No. 5, was disturbed by
knocks at her door (<i>cf.</i> Mrs. <span class="ws">W&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> experience in the
same room), and to-night is to sleep in my room, No. 8,
which last night was also somewhat noisy, but she will
not be alone. The Rev. <span class="ws">MacD&mdash;&mdash;</span> looks so ill from two
nights' sleeplessness that the priests are to go into the
wing to-night. They were unwilling to move, and made
no complaints, and now do not say they have seen anything,
merely that the evil influence about them was
painful and disturbing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who, it will be remembered, was much disturbed
during her last visit, begged that she might be
quiet, and we gave her No. 7. She is the only person
who has had a really good night, except Mr. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who
had a fancy to sleep in the smoking-room, in the hope
of a visit from the Major, but nothing happened. As he
had been mountaineering all day, he probably would have
slept well under any conditions.</p>

<p><i>May 4th.</i>&mdash;I am thankful to say the priests slept well
in the wing. Madame Boisseaux, in No. 5, was disturbed
by knocks at her door, but as she wisely remarked,<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>
they had the advantage of being outside. Mr. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> had
moved into No. 1, and slept fairly well, but said he
felt as before, "not alone," but as he <i>had</i> felt that before,
expectation may count for something.</p>

<p>Mrs. "F" slept with me; I was awoke early by my
dog crying, and I saw two black paws resting on the table
beside the bed. It gave me a sickening sensation, and I
longed to wake Mrs. "F" to see if she would see them,
but I remembered her bad night of yesterday, and left
her in peace.</p>

<p>The priests spend much time in devotions, and are very
decided in their views as to the malignity of the influence.
The bishop comes to-day, and we hope he will have Mass
said in the house. We shall then have ten Roman
Catholics in the household&mdash;two visitors, three clergy, two
visitors' maids, and three of our own servants. That should
have an effect upon the Major! Miss Moore and Scamp
arrived.</p>

<p><i>May 5th.</i>&mdash;The bishop is in No. 1. He arrived to lunch
to-day. Last night all was quiet after bedtime, but
sitting in the drawing-room about five o'clock, having just
come in from a drive, five of us heard the detonating
noise, as it were in the empty room overhead. Madame
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Mrs. "F," Mrs. <span class="ws">M&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the Rev. <span class="ws">MacL&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and
myself. Mrs. "F" left this morning.</p>

<p>The priests went with me to the copse. They saw
nothing, but were in too anxious a state to be receptive.
I saw Ishbel for one moment. She looked <i>agonised</i>, as
never before.</p>

<p>Mr. B. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> dined with us, and the servants, indoor
and out, danced in the hall in the evening. We had
pipers, and some supper for them in the billiard-room.<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>
The gardener and the butler and cook say there was a
great crash in the room just when the parish minister
was saying grace, and that many of the people from outside
noticed it, and "they just looked at each other." I
was myself in the room, but as we had just had a very
physical and commonplace disturbance&mdash;the arrival of an
uninvited and intoxicated guest, of which the other people
did not know as I did&mdash;I was preoccupied at the moment.</p>

<p>Mass this morning in the drawing-room.</p>

<p><i>May 6th.</i>&mdash;Madame Boisseaux has had to go suddenly;
there has been terrible news for her of this Paris fire.
She came into my room very early with her telegram
(arrived too late for delivery last night). I did not like
to worry her with questions, overwhelmed as she was,
but she said her room "resounded with knocks."</p>

<p>There was Mass said in the ground-floor sitting-room
this morning, and as I knelt facing the window I saw
Ishbel with the grey woman, nearer the house than ever
before. She looked pensive, but, as compared with last
time, much relieved.</p></div>

<br />

<p>This is the last time the figures were seen.
The following details are quoted from a letter
written by Miss Freer to Lord Bute on this day:
"Mass was said this morning in the downstairs
room, the altar arranged in front of the window,
so that, as we knelt, we faced the garden.
Poor Madame Boisseaux was dressed for travelling,
and in much agitation. As the carriage
which was to take her to the station was<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>
expected at any moment, I suggested that she
and I should remain upstairs, but she said she
should like to be there, if only for a few minutes,
the more that the 'intention' was to be partly for
those who had suffered in the fire, and for their
sorrowing friends. She and I, therefore, knelt
close to the door, keeping it slightly ajar, so as
to be able to obey a summons at any moment.</p>

<p>"Suddenly she touched my arm, and directed
my attention to the window. There I saw a
figure standing outside, which&mdash;so slow-sighted
am I&mdash;I took for the moment for Madame's maid,
and thought she had come to call our attention
through the window&mdash;a long 'French' one,
opening out on to the lawn&mdash;as less likely to
disturb the service. I was starting up when
I perceived that the figure was 'Ishbel'&mdash;the
black gown, like that worn by the maid, had
misled me for the moment. 'Marget' seemed
to hover in the background, but she was much
less distinct than the other. A minute later
we were called away.</p>

<p>"The room had been selected by the priests
themselves, but it is the one I should myself, for
obvious reasons, have chosen for the purpose."</p>

<p><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></p>

<div class="block"><p>When the bustle of Madame's hasty departure was
over, and we had breakfasted, the bishop blessed the
house from top to bottom, and especially visited rooms
Nos. 1, 3, and 8, and also the library. He sprinkled the
rooms with holy water, and especially the doorway leading
to the drawing-room, where noises have so often been
heard. He and the priests had hardly gone when there
was a loud bang upon a little table that stands there.
It is an old work-table, a box on tall, slender legs, and the
sound could easily be imitated by lifting the lid and
letting it fall smartly, but I saw no movement&mdash;not that
I was watching it at the moment. The bishop and
priests returned, and the ceremony was repeated, after
which the bang again occurred, but much more faintly.</p>

<p>The three clergy left this afternoon. Miss Moore and
I are now alone.</p></div>

<br />

<p>This bang was the last phenomenon of an
abnormal kind during this tenancy. Miss Moore
and Miss Freer stayed in the house another
week without anything further occurring either
to themselves, their guests, or the servants.</p>

<p>During that time, they received six more
guests: Miss <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Miss "Etienne," with her
brother, a lawyer, and three other visitors, with
whom Miss Freer had no previous acquaintance,
but who received an invitation under the following
special conditions, not being, as were other
guests, personal friends, or, in one or two<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>
instances, accompanying personal friends by whom
they were introduced, and at whose request they
were invited.</p>

<p>Sir William Huggins had some time before
written to Lord Bute to beg him to obtain
admission to the house for Sir James Crichton
Browne, who is, of course, well known as a
physician of great eminence, and in especial as
an expert in psychology, and whom Sir William
stated to be deeply interested in phenomena
such as those observed at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>Lord Bute accordingly wrote to Miss Freer,
who wrote to Sir James. He did not immediately
reply, which surprised her, after so earnest
a request, and because admission to the house
for the purpose of such observations was a mark
of confidence, which as a hostess she was very
chary of giving, and which would never have
been extended to him, notwithstanding his
scientific eminence, had it not been for the
intercession of Sir William Huggins and Lord
Bute, through whom he had sought it.</p>

<p>He wrote to her after some time, apologising
for the delay on the score of illness,
begging to know if it were still possible for<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>
him to be admitted, and whether he might
bring with him a scientific friend. Miss Freer
consented, and he then wrote announcing his
arrival and that of a nephew, a student at
Oxford, interested in science. He then asked,
by telegram, whether a third guest could be
admitted, to which she also consented, and his
two friends, one of whom is believed to have
been the anonymous <i>Times</i> correspondent, accordingly
came, four days after the phenomena
had, as has been stated, apparently ceased.
The way in which this hospitality was repaid
is a matter of common knowledge. Their hostess
knew of no intention to make copy of their
visit, with full names, geographical indications,
and repetition of private conversations, until
the publication of the <i>Times'</i> article of June
8th. They remained from Saturday evening
till Monday morning, and, like others, saw and
heard nothing; and much time was spent in
repeating the already often repeated experiments
as to possible sources of the sights and
sounds observed at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Their observations
appeared to be able to penetrate no further
than the mark of the shoe which Miss Freer<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>
pointed out on the door in the wing, made
subsequently to the flight of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family,
a passage under the roof, with which the
household had long been as familiar as with the
hall-door, and the suggestion that a certain
stream might run under the house, the which
stream runs nowhere near the house at all, as
Miss Freer was already well aware, a fact which
she demonstrated for their benefit on a map of
the estate.</p>

<p>This is perhaps a suitable point at which to
add a letter from the head-gardener who has
been referred to more than once, more especially
as an important witness to the phenomena of
the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s'</span> tenancy.</p>

<p>He writes to Miss Freer in reference to a
statement by <i>The Times</i> correspondent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>July 8th, '97.</i>&mdash; ... I might also mention
to you, while writing, that 'the intelligent
gardener' that was made mention of in <i>The
Times</i> was a journeyman, and not myself, as
many have supposed. I thought it proper to tell
you, madam, because I told you and several
others that I was in the house and had heard
something."</p>

<p><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><i>The Times</i> correspondent's statement is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An intelligent gardener whom I questioned
told me that he had kept watch in the house
on two separate occasions, abstaining from sleep
until daylight appeared at seven o'clock, but
without hearing a sound."</p>

<p>The under gardener's experience of two nights
is as exhaustive of the subject as that of <i>The
Times</i> correspondent and his friends, who also
remained two nights, but do not allege that
they "abstained from sleep."</p>

<p>Mr. "Etienne" was the last guest at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
and arrived the evening before the house was
vacated. He afterwards told Lord Bute that he
had brought, without the knowledge of any one
in the house, two seismic instruments, but that
they recorded nothing, and that during the
night he heard a sound as of a gun being fired
outside the house. This he attributed to some
poacher unknown, an explanation which seems
hardly probable, as at this time of year there is
nothing to shoot except rabbits. One never
hears of a poacher shooting rabbits, and in any
case, he would hardly do so in the immediate<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>
neighbourhood of an inhabited house, and discharging
his gun once only.</p>

<p>Mr. "Etienne's" experiments are the more interesting
because that among many suggestions
made by Sir J. Crichton Browne, the only one
which had not been already considered, was the
use of seismic instruments. This&mdash;the house
being within the seismic area&mdash;seemed so reasonable,
that Miss Freer at once entered into correspondence
with the well-known Professor Milne,
with a view to experiment in this direction.
The following is from his reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>May 15th, 1897.</i>&mdash;I was much interested in
your note of the 13th, and fancy that the
sounds with which you have to deal may be
of seismic origin. Such sounds I have often
heard, and the air waves, if not the earth waves,
can be mechanically recorded. What you require
to make the records is a seismograph with
large but exceeding light indices, or a Perry
tromometer.... The reason I think that the
sounds are seismic is, first, on account of their
character, and secondly, because you are in one
of the most unstable parts of Great Britain,
where between 1852 and 1890, 465 shocks<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>
(many with sounds) were recorded. Lady
Moncrieff, when living at Comrie House in
1844, often heard rumblings and moanings,
and such sounds, possibly akin to the 'barisal
guns'<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> of Eastern England, often occur without
a shake. The mechanism of this production
may be due to slight movements on a fault
face, and they may be heard, especially in rocky
districts, in very many countries...."</p>

<p>Miss Freer's reply was an urgent request that
machinery and an operator might be at once
sent up to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> Professor Milne replied that
delicate instruments, such as he himself employed,
could only be used by one other person,
but suggested that she should hire from a
well-known London firm what are known as
"Ewing's-type" seismometers, adding, "I doubt
whether these will record anything but movements
to which you are sensible."</p>

<p>Miss Freer's designs, however, were frustrated,
for on applying for an extension of tenancy for
this purpose, Captain <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the proprietor, peremptorily
forbade the continuance of scientific
observation&mdash;a remarkable parallel to his father's<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>
refusal to permit the use of the phonograph
when suggested by Sir William Huggins.</p>

<p>In relation to his experiments at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> Mr.
"Etienne" writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord Bute has asked me to describe a seismographic
instrument which I used during my
short visit to <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> The instrument consisted
of a light wooden frame or platform which rested
on three billiard-balls. The balls in their turn
rested on a horizontal plate of plate-glass.
Through two wire rings in the centre of the
platform already mentioned a needle stood
perpendicularly, resting on its point on the
plate of glass. The centre of the plate of glass
(and the area round it and within in the triangle
describable with the balls at its angles) was
smoked. You will see that the parts of such
an instrument are held together by gravitation,
and a very little friction, and that a tremor communicated
to the plate will not simultaneously
affect the platform. The needle-point describes
on the smoked surface which it moves across
the converse of any movement of the plate
which is not simultaneously a movement of the
platform, and the error between this and the<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>
description of the tremor drawn by an absolutely
fixed point&mdash;say the earth itself&mdash;has been calculated
on a replica of this instrument as equal to
the error of a pendulum thirty feet long."</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the phenomena began,
so far as Miss Freer was concerned, upon the
night of her arrival in the house, February 3rd,
and ceased (if we except the sound heard by
Mr. Etienne), after the service performed by
the Bishop on the morning of May 6th. This
period comprises ninety-two days, but from
these must be subtracted the seventeen days
between Miss Freer's leaving <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> on the
morning of April 9th, and that of the departure
of Mr. Myers's medium, Miss "K.," on the
morning of April 26th.</p>

<p>Of the remaining seventy-five days, Miss
Freer was absent from the house for four days,
from March 16th to March 20th, and for two
nights after Miss "K.'s" leaving; during this
latter interval, however, Lord Bute was himself
on the spot. On the other hand, she remained
in the house for eight days after the service
performed by the Bishop, during which time
no phenomena occurred.</p>

<p><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>Of the sixty-nine days of which a record is
kept in the journal, viz., from February 3rd to
May 14th, exclusive of twenty-three days for the
reasons already indicated, daytime phenomena
occurred upon eighteen days, and night phenomena
upon thirty-five nights.</p>

<p>To these must be added the night of April
27th, the occasion of the vision seen by
Carter the housemaid during Lord Bute's visit.
Thirty-four nights, or almost exactly half the
period, were entirely without record of any
phenomena whatever. This is without counting
the seven nights of the last week, during
which there were observers for longer or shorter
periods in the house, none of whom recorded
any sight or sound of a supernormal kind,
unless it were the percussive or detonating
noise heard by Mr. "Etienne."</p>

<p>The term "night" is here understood to
cover the period between the hour of going to
rest at night, to that of leaving one's room next
morning, even if the phenomena occurred in
the daylight hours of the early morning. The
term "day" is used to cover the hours of active,
waking life, from breakfast to bedtime.</p>

<p><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>To sum up the character of the phenomena,
it may be well to begin with those that are
<i>visual</i>.</p>

<p>1. The phantasm of the Rev. P. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;.</span>
This was seen once only, and by Miss Langton,
on the night of February 17th. Of the identity
no doubt can be felt, since Miss Moore and
Miss Freer afterwards recognised the accuracy
of the description on meeting the Rev. P.
<span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> for the first time, in a crowded railway
station on May 25th. This is the only one of
the apparitions which is undoubtedly that of
a living person, and like many such apparitions,
it occurred at an hour when it is
probable that he was asleep. <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> is a
place to which Father <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;'s</span> thoughts were
naturally and disagreeably drawn, and to which
his attention had been called anew. On
awaking, he would probably have no recollection
of the circumstances, or at the utmost
would have an impression of having dreamt
that he was there.</p>

<p>2. The woman once seen by Miss Freer in
the drawing-room. She was older than Sarah
<span class="ws">N&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who died at the age of twenty-seven,<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>
but of whose haunting of <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> there is some
tradition, but assisted by the parish register
of marriages and births it is not difficult to
form a guess at the identity of the phantasm.
As there is some uncertainty as to whether
the person in question is still living, though
it is probable that she is dead, the vision is
mentioned here before those as to which there
is no reason to doubt that they represent the
dead. There is reason to believe that the same
apparition has been seen by former occupants
of the house, and it is alleged to be that of a
member of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family.</p>

<p>3. The phantasm seen by Carter the housemaid,
on the night of April 27th, who was described
as "rather old," may possibly have been
identical with the above.</p>

<p>4. The nun to whom was given the name
of "Ishbel." This subject has been already
discussed, and the suggestion thrown out that
the phantasm was an erroneous mental picture
of the late Rev. Mother Frances Helen, evolved
from the imagination of a half-educated person
who had never seen the lady in question, and
knew little about her. This figure was seen<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>
many times by Miss Freer and Miss Langton,
twice by the Rev. Mr. "Q.," and probably by
Madame Boisseaux, who unhappily died suddenly
before the editors had an opportunity of
asking her for exact information. There were
also earlier witnesses. She was never seen elsewhere
than in the glen, except once by Miss
Langton, and on the one occasion when a
Bishop was saying Mass in the house, and Miss
Freer saw her outside the window just after
the elevation of the chalice. It was stated,
however, by two separate witnesses, that a
figure, probably the same, had been seen inside
the house on at least one occasion, when, some
years before Colonel Taylor's tenancy, Mrs.
<span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> was keeping her room, and a maid who
was bringing up a tray met the figure on the
stairs, and experienced such a start that she
dropped the tray.</p>

<p>5. The lay-woman dressed in grey to whom
was given the name of "Marget," and who was
sometimes seen in the company of "Ishbel,"
usually as though upbraiding or reproving her.
She was seen by Miss Freer and Miss Langton,
and her voice in conversation with "Ishbel" was<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>
heard not only by them, but by Mr. <span class="ws">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
Miss Moore, Mr. "Q." and Miss "Duff" (<i>cf.</i>
Mrs. G.'s evidence, p. 68).</p>

<p>6. The appearance of the wooden crucifix
seen in No. 3. It was about eighteen inches
long, and the figure was of the same wood
as the cross. Its earliest appearance is to
the Rev. P. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;.</span> It afterwards appeared
to the Rev. Mr. "Q.," and lastly to Miss
Freer, none of the witnesses knowing anything
in detail of the experience of the
others. It was also seen in the crystal by
Miss Langton&mdash;possibly by thought transference
from others.</p>

<p>When the Rev. P. <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> saw it he was
always drowsy, but when it appeared to Mr.
"Q." its appearance was immediately preceded
by a sensation of acute chill on his part, and its
appearance to Miss Freer by a similar sensation
on the part of "Endell." It is perhaps worth
while to remark, that we are told that among
spiritualists the sensation of cold is supposed to
be an unfavourable indication as to the character
of the spirits who are present, and that in the
cases of both Mr. "Q." and Mr. "Endell" the<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>
appearance of the crucifix seemed to put an end
to the chill.</p>

<p>7. The dogs. These were much more often
heard than seen, the sounds being those of
their pattering footsteps, sometimes as of
their bounding about in play, and sometimes
of their throwing themselves against the lower
part of doors. It seemed, however, that they
were visible to Miss Freer's living dog at times
when they were not visible to her, and indeed
the abject terror which the Pomeranian displayed
in No. 8 was so distressing, that she
changed her room from No. 8 to No. 5 in
consequence.</p>

<p>A dog was, moreover, seen by Miss Freer and
Miss Langton in the smoking-room on April 8th;
Miss Freer and Miss Moore have described more
than one occasion when they felt themselves
pushed as by a dog; and on the night of
May 4th, Miss Freer saw the two forepaws only,
of another and larger black dog resting on the
edge of a table in No. 8.</p>

<p>Other apparitions seen in the house by former
occupants were described to members of Colonel
Taylor's party as well as to earlier tenants, but<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>
here, as elsewhere, we have refrained from all
quotation from the relatives of the present
proprietor.</p>

<p>It is interesting to remark that one apparition
which was constantly expected during Colonel
Taylor's tenancy was expected in vain. This
was that of the little old gentleman with stooping
form and limping gait mentioned by earlier
witnesses. His peculiar step was heard very
frequently, and by a great number and variety
of witnesses, alone and collectively; and his
appearance, naturally enough, was constantly
looked for, but it never occurred.</p>

<p>In the same way there was one expected
sound which never occurred, though frequent
in the experience of earlier witnesses&mdash;that of
the rustling of a silk dress, suggesting to the
mind of the hearer the idea of some one who,
either in fact or in thought, had worn such a
garment.</p>

<p><i>Tactile.</i> The most important of these were
the experiences of Miss "N." on the night of
March 3rd, and of Miss "Duff" on the night of
March 22nd, both in No. 3; and of a maid, Lizzie,
on the night of March 23rd, in the room above<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>
No. 3, on the attic storey, who all testified to
the sensation of the moving of the bed, or the
handling of the bed-clothes. These were the
only occasions during Colonel Taylor's tenancy,
but the phenomenon is one often testified to
by earlier witnesses, both during the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s'</span>
tenancy and that of the family of the late
Mr. <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>It presents a peculiar difficulty in the way of
the theory that all the phenomena at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
were subjective hallucinations, and this is especially
the case with regard to the evidence of a
witness who has not been brought forward in
the preceding pages, but whose account of a
similar experience is reported by two first-hand
witnesses. On one occasion he had
the whole of the upper bed-clothes lifted
from off him and thrown upon the floor,
while a pile of wearing apparel, which was
laid on a chair beside the bed, was thrown
in his face.</p>

<p>It is of course conceivable that the whole of
these experiences, including the last, were the
result of an hallucination; but on the other
hand, it would be very unwise, in the present<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>
state of our ignorance on the subject, to dogmatise
as to the possible action of unseen forces
upon what is commonly called matter. It is
interesting to note that this senseless and
childish trick coincides with what was said by
Miss <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> as to the presence of mischievous
elementals, and also what she says as to
<i>apports</i>.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>1. The sensation of the movement of the bed
itself, whether as being rocked, as in the experience
of Miss "Duff" on March 22nd, and of Miss
Langton on several occasions, and by guests of
the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> family, or of being lifted up, as in
that of the maid Lizzie, is a phenomenon by no
means uncommon, and if objective is of the
nature of levitation; but we have unfortunately
no evidence from a second person observing the
phenomenon from outside. Whether it were
actually moved it is impossible to say, but the
sensation seems to have been more than subjective.</p>

<p>2. The sensation of struggling with something
unseen, described by Miss "Duff," March 22nd,
and of the sensation of an incumbent weight,
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>as described by Miss "Duff" (same date) and
Miss "N." on March 2nd. This coincides
with the arrest of his hand experienced by
Harold Sanders. These phenomena adapt
themselves to the theory of subjectivity more
easily than the foregoing, because they more
closely resemble those of nightmare (familiar
to most persons), although they occurred while
the witnesses were awake.</p>

<p>3. The sensation of being pushed by a dog was
experienced in two different rooms by Miss Freer
and Miss Moore respectively. If Mr. "Endell"
were touched by Ishbel on the evening of
March 1st, as appeared to Miss Freer to be
the case, he had no independent consciousness
of the fact that might not have been referred
to expectation, so that this cannot be regarded
as evidential.</p>

<p>For lack of other classification, we mention
under this heading of "tactile" the sensation
of chill experienced by Mr. "Endell" and
Mr. <span class="ws">Q&mdash;&mdash;</span> in No. 3, and which appears to
be the same as that described by Harold
Sanders as the sensation of "entering an
ice-house."</p>

<p><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>The <i>audile</i> phenomena were so frequent and
so various, that a conspectus of them is given
in an appendix. Some of them appeared to
be human in origin, such as voices, reading or
speaking, footsteps, and, according to earlier
witnesses, screams and moans. Others might
have been caused by dogs, such as pattering
footsteps, jumping and pouncing as in play,
the wagging of a dog's tail against the door,
and the sound as of a dog throwing itself
against the lower panels. Other sounds have
been differentiated, as the <i>detonating</i> or explosive
noise; the <i>clang</i> sound, as of the
striking of metal upon wood; the <i>thud</i> or
heavy fall without resonance; and the <i>crash</i>,
which was never better described than as if
one of the beasts' heads on the staircase wall
had fallen into the hall below. It very often,
or almost always, seemed to occur under the
glass dome which lighted the body of the house,
and the falling object seemed to strike others
in its descent, so that it was not ineffectively
imitated by rolling a bowl along the stone
floor of the hall, and allowing it to strike
against the doors or pillars, when the<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>
peculiar echoing quality was fairly reproduced
by the hollow domed roof and surrounding
galleries.</p>

<p>The editors offer no conclusions. This
volume has been put together, as the house at
<span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was taken, not for the establishment of
theories, but for the record of facts.</p>

<p>A lady, known to readers of <i>Proceedings
S.P.R.</i> as Miss <span class="ws">A&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who is an habitual
automatic writer, but whose social position removes
her from the temptations and tendencies
of the ordinary so-called medium, was good
enough on March 10, 1897, to contribute the
following automatic script in reply to a request
from Lord Bute:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not much care for the influence of this
house; it is most decidedly haunted, but not
by any particularly good spirits, the haunting
being carried on by mischievous elementals, and
as far as I can make out there is some one who
lives there through all the changes, who supplies
a great deal of force, and who is not
aware of the power. I think that a great deal
more is added to what really takes place, as
the hauntings appear to me to consist of disturbing
noises, with now and then a case of<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>
apport, for the elementary forces are not
sufficient to produce forms unless a great deal
of outside force is given.</p>

<p>"The forms that would appear would always
be different, as each mediumistic person would
supply his own surroundings. The only one I
am not sure about is the shadowy figure of an
old man whom I have twice seen in rather a
dark passage, and from his surrounding light I
should say he may often be there.</p>

<p>"I think the noises would stop of themselves,
at least the more disturbing part, if a less
attentive attitude were taken towards them."</p>

<p>These statements present certain interesting
points as coming from one who had never seen
the house, and knew nothing of its phenomena.
"The shadowy figure of an old man in a dark
passage" seems to point to the figure, possibly,
of the Major, seen by earlier witnesses in the
dark lobby&mdash;the only dark corner in the house&mdash;outside
the door of the downstairs smoking-room,
and whose voice was heard there by Miss
Freer, Miss Langton, and Mr. <span class="ws">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> during the
tenancy of Colonel Taylor.</p>

<p>An occasion upon which the phenomena<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>
might be described as those of "mischievous
elementals," and also of <i>apports</i>, is referred to
in the summing up of tactile phenomena,
though it did not occur during the tenancy of
Colonel Taylor.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the phenomena were often
more active when least looked for, and some of
those most expected never occurred. As there
was not even a servant, nor even a dumb animal,
common to the occupation of the <span class="ws">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> family
and the tenancy of the <span class="ws">H&mdash;&mdash;s</span> or Colonel
Taylor, we are at a loss to know who the
person can be who lives at <span class="ws">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> through all
the changes, and supplies force during the past
twenty years.</p>

<h4>BARISAL GUNS. (<a href="#Page_221"><i>See page 221.</i></a>)</h4>
<br />


<p>Readers not acquainted with this phenomenon
may be referred to an interesting correspondence
in the pages of <i>Nature</i> (Oct. 1895, and <i>Seq.</i>),
opened by Professor G.H. Darwin&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the delta of the Ganges," he says, "dull
sounds, more or less resembling distant artillery,
are often heard. These are called Barisal
guns, but I do not know the meaning of the
term."</p>

<p>The same sounds have been recorded by
M. Rutot of the Geological Survey along the
Belgian coast, and are alleged to be pretty
common in the North of France. M. van der
Broeck, Conservator of the Museum of Natural
History of Belgium, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have constantly noticed these sounds in
the plain of Limburg since 1880;&mdash;more than<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>
ten of my personal acquaintances have observed
the fact. The detonations are dull and distant,
and are repeated a dozen times or more at
irregular intervals. They are usually heard in
the daytime, when the sky is clear, and especially
towards evening after a very hot day.
The noise does not at all resemble artillery,
blasting in mines, or the growling of distant
thunder."</p>

<p>M. van der Broeck elsewhere refers to "similar
noises heard on Dartmoor, and in some
parts of Scotland." Readers of Blackmore's
story of "Lorna Doone" will remember, among
other valuable observations of out-door life,
his accounts of "the hollow moaning sound"
during the intense cold of the winter, of which
he gives so graphic an account. It was "ever
present in the air, morning, noon, and night
time, and especially at night, whether any wind
was stirring or whether it were a perfect calm"
(Chap. xlvi.).</p>

<p>Another correspondent in <i>Nature</i> refers to
remarkable noises among the hills of Cheshire:
"When the wind is easterly, and nearly calm
on the flats, a hollow moaning sound is heard,<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>
popularly termed the Soughing of the Wind,
which Sir Walter Scott, in his glossary to
'Guy Mannering,' interprets as a hollow blast
or whisper."</p>

<p>Another writer quotes experiences in East
Anglia, tending to show that such sounds may
be reports arising from the process of "faulting"
going on, on a small scale, at a great depth, and
not of sufficient intensity to produce a perceptible
vibration at the earth's surface.</p>

<p>It would seem that in districts such as Comrie
in Perthshire, East Hadden in Connecticut,
Pignerol in Piedmont, Meleda in the Adriatic,
&amp;c., sounds without shocks are common during
intervals, which may last for several years.
Remarkable sounds, not apparently accounted
for, are reported to proceed from Lough Neagh
in Ireland.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p class="cen">[Compare Plan of House.]</p>


<p>1. The rooms spoken of in the text as "the library," and the "upstairs,"
or "wing" smoking-room, are those marked in the Plan as the
"morning-room," and the bedroom to the extreme east in the wing.</p>

<p>2. Most of the maid-servants slept in rooms Y and Z, over 1 and 2,
until the alarm of March 25, when they moved to the rooms on the other
side the house (X and W), thus leaving those over Nos. 1 and 2 empty.</p>

<p>3. Robinson and Mrs. Robinson (butler and cook) occupied room W
till March 13, when both moved into the butler's room off the hall, which
during the first month had been occupied by Mac the maid, who became
ill and returned south.</p>

<p>4. Opinions regarding the noises, and experiments as to their origin,
will be found on the under-mentioned pages of the Journal.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
